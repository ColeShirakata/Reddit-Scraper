Spain was one of the first countries that agreed to help. In exchange for their assistance, Egypt and Sudan donated to the Spanish Government thousands of objects found at the archeological sites and the Egyptian government also donated the Temple of Debod, which was relocated to Madrid between 1970 and 1972.\nBesides Debod, Egypt also donated the Temple of Dendur to the USA, Temple of Taffeh to the Netherlands and the Temple of Ellesyia to Italy. !<", "id": "146252z", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/didyouknow/comments/146252z/dyk_ykw_which_temple_in_madrid_was_a_gift_from/", "created_utc": 1686408401.0, "score": 1, "permalink": "/r/didyouknow/comments/146252z/dyk_ykw_which_temple_in_madrid_was_a_gift_from/", "comments": [], "URLs": ["https://youknowwhatblog.com/quizzes/general-knowledge-quiz-44/)!", "https://youknowwhatblog.com/quizzes/general-knowledge-quiz-44/](https://youknowwhatblog.com/quizzes/general-knowledge-quiz-44/)"], "html_title": ["quizzes general knowledge quiz", "quizzes general knowledge quiz https youknowwhatblog com quizzes general knowledge quiz"]}, {"title": "DYK the \"s\" word evolved over centuries, an abbreviation of \"shiver me timbers\"", "selftext": "", "id": "1461ji8", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/didyouknow/comments/1461ji8/dyk_the_s_word_evolved_over_centuries_an/", "created_utc": 1686406900.0, "score": 0, "permalink": "/r/didyouknow/comments/1461ji8/dyk_the_s_word_evolved_over_centuries_an/", "comments": ["JFC man.
