[{"title": "Is that Lovecraft?", "selftext": "He was born in a dark place, surrounded by sharp objects that glinted ominously. It was a tin, a tin that enclosed a room\u2014an isolated chamber where his kind no longer existed. The air was frigid, and he shivered in his solitude, a small, fragile being seeking solace.  \nBut then, his senses detected a faint warmth emanating from beneath the transparent steel surface of the tin. A flicker of hope ignited within him, propelling him to scuttle and crawl tirelessly, desperate to find a crevice leading to the depths below. After an arduous journey, he discovered a gap\u2014a gateway to something unknown\u2014and without hesitation, he slipped inside. A lost child in embrace of an unknown thing. It\u2019s presence exudes an almost magnetic allure, drawing him closer against their better judgment.  \nInexplicable whispers, barely audible, danced upon the wind, whispering secrets known only to the warm box and the realms it represented. His curiosity, tinged with equal parts dread and fascination, grew insatiable, driving them to pry open the lid, as if succumbing to an otherworldly siren's call.  \nThe air started changing inside the box and thick white smoke came towards him. A tsunami of magical fog came upon his senses and Visions, fragmented and nightmarish, flickered through the mortal's mind, as if whispered from the darkest corners of existence. Cosmic vistas of unfathomable scale and monstrous entities beyond mortal ken assaulted their senses, leaving them trembling in awe and terror.  \nThe mortal's perception of reality wavered, the boundaries of their existence blurring, as they became entangled in the web of eldritch truths unfurled by the box. They felt as though their mortal limitations were shattered, their consciousness reaching out to touch the outer edges of a vast, incomprehensible universe.  \nYet, with each fleeting glimpse into the abyss, the mortal's grip on their sanity weakened. The insatiable hunger for forbidden knowledge became a devouring madness, gnawing at their mind with insidious whispers and eldritch whispers. They teetered on the precipice of a maddening revelation, their mortal identity unraveling thread by thread.  \nThe compulsion, once a tantalizing allure, now revealed itself as a merciless trap. The mortal, once captivated by the box's allure, found themselves caught in a spiral of cosmic dread, forever entwined with the enigmatic forces they had unwittingly awakened.  \nIn the end, the mortal stood as a mere vessel, shattered and consumed by the insidious influence of the square box\u2014a tragic figure forever lost in the maddening depths of forbidden knowledge and indescribable horror.  \n\\*\\*\\*  \n\u2018Is that Lovecraft?\u2019  \n\u2018Kinda\u2019  \n\u2018You write great but what\u2019s up with your A.C?\u2019  \n\u2018Oh.

And when the women gather around the river, washboards and laundry in tow, they bring their little girls and their dolls so they may pick the late spring daisies and frolic around in the May air like summer kites in the sun. An early morning breeze would sweep between the trees and wind up and down the dirt paths tracing the river and the cabins across.

They would run and squeal when caught by a boy, overcome with the urge to dance and toss a girl up into the air to see Jesus before coming down to do it all over again. And in the frenzy, a girl no older than nineteen would lose her flower on the dirt to a farmer\u2019s son who eyed her like a wolf stalking prey. \n\n\tAnd when the deed is done, the fiddler will play a boisterous tune to which the people cheer and scream at the hastened tempo that compels their feet to stomp faster than they have ever known. He will make them seize the night and praise God by stamping the rooftops of Hell like an unforgiving rainfall: a downpour of grievances from the golden gates of Heaven.

And it was still dark enough that the glass eyes of the cogbirds shone like amber gemstones in the scraggly trees around him, their internal reactors quiet in the dim morning. It would be a few more hours before the sun warmed their panel wings enough to swarm him, so he had plenty of time.\n\nGareth pulled off his back and knelt at the edge of the ravine with his hammer-pick. He used the sharp end to gently dig out the cliff, careful not to undermine himself. More than one miner had hit stinkdamp gas pockets in this area. Oil-soaked clods fell silently into the mist-shrouded pit below. Finally, he struck something hard. He reached around the ledge, feeling into the hole as his eyes stared into the deep. From the hole he pulled up a mass of black glass. Smoked obsidian.\n\nGareth stuffed it into his pack and licked his fingers before continuing to dig, finding several more masses. He twitched when he heard the screech of a cogbird behind him. He looked over his shoulder as several of them hopped along the tungsten branches, their little reactors glowing. Gareth looked up and saw no sun. He looked across the ravine. The temple light was shading to crimson.\n\nGareth cinched his pack closed and pulled it on, steeling himself for the run. One of the cogbirds positioned itself right in the middle of the path. Gareth knew it was over if he hesitated. He charged forward, whacking the cogbird with his hammer-pick as it came at him. He didn\u2019t stop, knowing they were swarming behind him. He smiled to himself as he ran into the darker depths of the woods. One day soon he would have enough obsidian. The days of that temple, and the cogbirds, were numbered.\n\n\\---\n\n*I write novels, short stories, and online interactives with flavors of epic fantasy, grimdark, historical fiction, and steampunk.

He was certainly different than most of the young professionals that were applying for the associate position at the Exchange.\n\n  \nHis hair was what Mr. Harding\u2019s father would have called \"high and tight,\" his suit was pressed, his shoes were shined.  That was enough to set him apart.  Suits had fallen out of style, even at firms as storied at the Exchange, most young applicants interviewing in \"business casual\" or \"fast casual\" or whatever term disguised the latest trend for slobbery.  Over the past two decades the venture capitalists had gained enough respect that their worst sartorial choices had bled over into other, more respectable, sectors.  Not for this candidate, though, one Mr. Summers.\n\n  \nHe was certainly more focused than the other applicants. He didn\u2019t have the usual cloud of notification signals that surrounded other young people.  Mr. Harding would often note when  applicants would unconsciously reach for their smartphone, even the pressure of a job interview unable to dampen that Pavlovian response.  It might have been that he didn\u2019t bring his device with him, but there was something about this Summers that told Harding it was more than forethought.\n\n  \nPerhaps his age had something to do with it.  For better or worse, Summers was older than most of the professionals that applied for associate positions at the Exchange.  Leaning back in his chair, Harding picked up the single-sheet of paper that was meant to sum up Summers\u2019 lifetime of professional experience.\n\n  \nThe reading glasses Harding stared down his nose through brought the sheet\u2019s writing into focus, but blurred everything else, which suited his purposes.  \"I see you joined the military in 2014.\"  \n\n\nMr. Summers bobbed his head and answered with a simple, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n  \n\"You were there for quite awhile, through the withdrawal, followed by an honorable discharge.\"  Harding made a show of flipping the paper over, inspecting the back, blank side.  \"There there\u2019s a sizable gap in your resum\u00e9.\"\n\n  \n\"Yes.\"  Summers cleared his throat.  \"After leaving the service I\u2026\" He paused, long enough that Harding glanced over his spectacles.  Seeing his attention, Summers replied with a steady, \"I had difficulty adjusting to civilian life.\"\n\n  \n\"For three years?\"  \n\"No, sir.  After a few months I was contacted by the Peachtree Group and offered a position there.  I went back overseas for most of that time.\"  \n\"Your curriculum vitae doesn\u2019t have that listed among your accomplishments.\"  Harding threw in a bit of Latin showmanship, smiling in the hopes of coaxing something of a human reaction out of Summers.  \nSummers remained immobile.  \"I don\u2019t really think of it as an accomplishment.\"  \nHarding stared quizzically at Summers.  \"The Peachtree Group does work for the Department of Defense, doesn\u2019t it?\"  \n\"Yes, sir.\"  \n\"So in a sense you were still serving your country.\"  \nThere was another long pause from Summers before he answered.  \"I suppose you could say that.\"  \n\"So what did you do while employed there?\"\n\n  \nSummers\u2019 face became grim.  Or grimmer.  Harding couldn\u2019t quite tell if that were possible.  He looked Harding directly in the eyes, though, when he responded, \"I\u2019m not at liberty to discuss it.\"  \nHarding had worked at the Exchange long enough to know secrets, the making and keeping of them, and found the young man's reply to be irksome.  \"Excuse me?\"  \n\n\nSummer's eyes flicked to his shoes, as if the answer might lie there.  Harding was certain there was more of an explanation coming, something about state secrets, images of redacted documents fanning out in his mind.  These spiraled into a small anecdote he would share at a cocktail party later, mentioning what an interesting fellow he had interviewed, a patriot and soldier that wasn't really qualified for the job, but his service had clearly earned him an opportunity at the Exchange.  \nInstead, when Summers' eyes came up they were that of a wounded animal, the steady discipline restraining a watery regret.  He only repeated, \"I'm not at liberty to discuss it.\"\n\n  \nSurprised by the change in temperament, Harding whipped the resume in his hand, cracking the crisp paper.  \"The firm has business with the DOD as well.  We've contracted with the Peachtree Group.\"  \n\n\nAt these words, Summer's eyes returned to their stony discipline, resting on Harding.  \"If you know that, you must have classified status.\"  \n\n\nHarding straightened in his chair, happy to let Summers know the type of man he was speaking with.  \"Of course I do.  I've been working for the Exchange for three decades.  My department handles international projects, particularly in the EMEA.\"  \n\n\n\"Then it was you who signed order GH-657.\"  \n\n\nAt the mention of this very specific corporate work order, Harding found his vision blurred for reasons completely unrelated to his reading glasses.  His chest tighten.  Images of the Sudan came into his mind.  Not actual eye witness events, of course.  He hadn't been stupid enough to be in that savage place personally, but some of the worst atrocities had made the news.  Focusing back on Summers again, he managed to get out, \"How did you \u2013 ?\"  \n\n\n\"The order was to hire a group of local contractors to remove squatters from a survey area where cobalt had been discovered.\"  Summers paused.  \"Were you ever curious about it was handled?\"  \n\"I didn't \u2013 \"\n\n  \n\"You didn't ask about the details.\"  A blink and the discipline in his eyes became a stoney emptiness.  \"Squatters is another word for 'refugee camp.' The contractors were a group of Janjaweed from Chad.  They don't much care for the local tribesfolk in the Sudan, so when they got the orders to remove the refugees they weren't real concerned about how.  I think maybe you know the rest.\" \n\n  \nHarding stared at Summers, chest deflated and mouth agape.  After a moment he managed, \"What exactly did you do for the Peachtree Group, Mr. Summers?\"  \n\n\n\"I'm not at liberty to say,\" Summers repeated, but then looked to the closed office door, almost as if X-ray vision allowed him to see the secretary beyond it.  Before he could ask what he was doing, Harding was shocked by the swiftness of the younger man as he moved around the desk.  \"But I'd be happy to show you.\"\n\n  \nHarding was almost able to call for help before Summers began his demonstration.

It looked like a cross between a gaming chair and a chair at the hair dresser\u2019s with the caps that dry and condition.  \n\u201cThat\u2019s alright,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI brought my own.\u201d He held up a full face helmet, much like a motorcyclist\u2019s, that was very high tech looking. There wasn\u2019t much padding on the inside. Instead, there was electrical wiring and magnetic neural regulators. The visor was tinted gold.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s the portable one that just came out,\u201d Paul added.  \nThe secretary nodded and smiled apprehensively. Paul took a seat on one of the plain chairs in the corner and put his helmet on.  \nPaul had taken a half day off from work. Business at the marketing agency was slow that time of year anyway. His boss didn\u2019t mind.  \nAs he sat down, he knew he had no obligations: no emails to check, no texts to answer. He had his fill of social media that morning before work, and then again at work. He couldn\u2019t even pretend to look busy. That\u2019s what the helmet was for.  \nThe helmet fit snugly around his head. A voice welcomed him and the visor displayed several options. It tracked his eye movements; Paul chose waiting room mode.  \nThe helmet played music and the visor displayed a band on stage. He had already customized all the settings the night before in anticipation for this doctor\u2019s appointment. The helmet filtered out light and sound from the outside world\u2014all except for a few things you might need to hear in the waiting room of a doctor\u2019s office. \u201cFill out this form.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s your insurance provider?\u201d And of course, it was customized to listen for, \u201cMr. Paul Rolland,\u201d or any variation of the name.  \nPaul sat back in his chair and let the helmet overtake him. It projected audio and visuals and manipulated his neurons so that he could feel the atmosphere of the concert. It was outdoors on a warm summer night. He felt mist and looked over at the beach in the distance, not too far from the amphitheater.  \nThe door squeaked and a patient entered the waiting room. Paul heard nothing.  \nAnother door closed heavily and a patient paid for her visit with the secretary. Paul was oblivious.  \nBehind the shield, Paul was bobbing his head to the music and mouthing the words emphatically. He smelled fruit juice and alcohol and lots of weed. The magnetic neural regulators excited his amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Euphoria overcame him. He felt an isolated bliss.  \n\u201cThe doctor will see you now,\u201d the secretary said from her window. The music stopped and the visor went black. Paul took his helmet off as the young woman across from him simultaneously took hers off as well. They accidentally made eye contact.  \nThe euphoria was gone. His heart raced and his stomach turned. He felt empty. Transparent. Fragile. Like a glass of water that had been sucked dry.  \nPaul shoved his head back in his helmet. That eye contact was completely unwarranted, he thought. It was unexpected and abnormal.  \n\u201cMr. Rolland,\u201d he heard. The visor lit up.  \n\u201cMr. Rolland,\u201d he heard again. He was filled with self awareness and stuck in a permanent state of cringe. His eyes navigated to meditation mode as he couldn\u2019t do anything until he was calm.  \n\u201cMr. Rolland,\u201d the secretary said vehemently. Paul didn\u2019t hear her. He didn\u2019t hear a thing besides the steady hum of an alpha frequency. He relaxed back into the chair and put his finger up blindly, as if to say \u201cone minute.\u201d  \nA gentle voice came over the helmet to guide his breathing. \u201cIn. Out,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice said delicately.  \nThe portable model privacy helmet sold out the day it launched.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you think.

It often made her smile, knowing that he had been up since before dawn, working on his obsessions.\n \nThe sound of his typing sometimes went like a freight train, a fast and rhythmic clatter that would change in intensity as it took a long corner or climbed a difficult hill.  Other times, it was like an excited commuter in morning traffic, rushing from one point to the next, coming to sudden, ponderous stops, only to accelerate again at some hidden signal.  Even others, it reminded her of an old pet chicken on her parents\u2019 farm in Pueblo, quick to skitter, stopping to peck, peck, peck, searching for the worm of the perfect word.\n\nThe disappearance of the sound was one of the first things she noticed, its absence a hole in the simple pleasures of a morning routine.  Even his beloved cat, Sam, had noticed, no longer satisfied to sleepily watch him work, but instead waking her by pawing her face.  One morning, so rudely awakened, knowing that he disliked being interrupted, but not hearing any sound issuing forth, she tip-toed to his study to find him bathed in the morning light of the eastern window.  She smiled to see him so at peace until she noticed that his hands weren\u2019t posed above the keyboard, but hung slack at his sides.  She watched him for a long moment before abandoning any pretense of stealth and walked in to say his name gently, like a question.  \u201cHusni?\u201d\n\nThe golden light of the morning couldn\u2019t wash the gray out of his skin as he turned to her.  His eyes swam in rheumy waters she had never seen before as his jaw worked, uttering nothing.

He didn\u2019t cry then, and she had been too shocked to, but they both did after the diagnosis.\n\nThe beast that the doctor\u2019s named was like something from her grandmother\u2019s stories, an invisible creature that stalked her Husni, slowly sapping away his essence, stealing him bit by bit.  It was small at first, moments like the first, but as the shroud over his mind expanded, the stain it left grew in time, each moment of his absence becoming longer.\n\nLitsa heard horror stories from loose-lipped nurses and tearful support group members, of parents and spouses that became unstuck in time, forgetting where they were or becoming obsessed with events or objects from long ago.  In a way that made her feel terribly guilty, she was grateful her and Husni were spared this, the predation by his own beast only stealing him away for longer and longer periods of time.  When it struck, she would guide him to sitting and then sit with him, holding his hand, hoping that it would help him find his way home.\n\nEven with oblivion knocking on the door, she would sometimes find herself waking to the sound of his old keyboard clacking away.  Sometimes this made her jealous, knowing that the morning was when he was most cognizant, most himself, and she wished that he would take these moments to be with her.  But then the sun would rise through the window and the birds would begin to sing.\n\nRising, she\u2019d find he had tidied the kitchen from the night before, fed their animals, and performed a dozen small chores that she had never noticed he had always done, clearing her path for the morning while the beast was yet unable to rob him of it.\n\nShe would put on coffee.  She would resist the urge to look at her phone, instead watching the sun rise, listening to him beat out his heart into words.\nAround the time when the light began to warm the kitchen, he would emerge to share coffee with her.  They would speak of any dreams they had the night before, plan their coming day around the growing holes in his brain and, eventually, he would rise to make them breakfast.  While it the midst of his culinary fussing, knowing enough time had passed between his imaginary world and the entrance into the kitchen, she would ask him how his morning had been.  It was then that he would humbly ask her to read his ever diminishing words.  She would smile and say, \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nThis was their time together.\n\nwww.matthewcmclean.com", "id": "13r2rwd", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/13r2rwd/what_you_are_looking_for_is_already_here/", "created_utc": 1684974368.0, "score": 4, "permalink": "/r/flashfiction/comments/13r2rwd/what_you_are_looking_for_is_already_here/", "comments": [], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "The Forest", "selftext": "\n I lay on the forest floor on the crest of a small hill between two trees.

Fur he had decided it was a moment later, given the circumstance it hanging upside-down by its legs like some hare caught in a boy's trap. \r  \nDarius believed the creature to be a myth, a legend, a fabrication of some red-neck trying to scare the locals, but here he was breathing the same air as Bigfoot! He couldn't believe it still, even with the creatures hot breath battering his senses, it reeked of organic plant matter, carrion, and halitosis. \r  \nOccasional groans and guttural noises quickened Darius's pace, he wouldn't have another opportunity to tag the creature. He had to work quickly. Daylight had already begun to slip into the velvet of night with a pattern of dazzling shapes sewn in. Darius collected samples of every fluid and tissue he could feasibly carry. The heft of his supplies quickly grew with each swap, each test tube of fluid, each bag of fur. Soon the light was gone, only the dazzling stars hung in the sky. The vast canopy makes even starlight sparse. \\*SNAP!\\*\r  \nDarius turns but it is too late, a large stick is aimed at his temple and the wielder is fully capable of killing him. At the last minute, he lifts his pack to absorb some of the impact... \\*CRACK! SHATTER!\\*\r  \nHis samples are destroyed by the monster's rampage, his skull thankfully is intact. With the cover of night, he slips under roots and brambles trying to escape. The creature spares him a chase, he can hear them communicating, if he hadn't just pissed himself he would stick around. \r  \n\r  \nRanger Grey sips her coffee, the campgrounds are pretty quiet around here during the early spring. Still too cold for flowers to bloom, and too much rain for tourists, or most of them that is... She has seen Darius's van in the same camping spot for going on 5 months now. The man was peculiar he spoke English well enough and kept his space tidy so she didn't think too much of him however, the returning scratched, bruised, and bloodied is what she worried about. What was that man doing in the mountains? No chance he was hunting cougars, he didn't ever carry a gun or a knife for that manner, just that damned pack and whatever was in it. As she takes another sip of her coffee a shout is heard coming from the trail... A male voice, a chill runs up her spine, it's been a while since an attack and she had hoped she wouldn't see another man mauled to death by a cougar but that was her job. Ranger Grey prepares for the worst, and she got so much more... \r  \nDarius lurches forward his legs badly torn up by some low-growing shrubs it seems, on the left side of his head are small splinters of glass. A look of relief washes over his face, Grey is shocked her eyes widen with confusion. She thought he was in his van, hadn't he returned last night? Did he sneak out after sunset to trek? The look of shock was replaced with irritation, then aggravation, and finally, a stern look that ripped what was left of Darius's dignity away. \r  \n\"This is your last warning Darius! I catch you wandering the camp after sunset you're gone!\" Grey Ordered. He know why the rules were there, hell he just lived through the event firsthand! Darius has been trying to stop the hunting in the area for some time, each time hunting season rolls around people end up missing. People blamed wolves, cougars, and bears, but Darius just found the real culprit and he couldn't tell Ranger Grey. He took his final warning and his pack to his van. It was time to analyze what he had managed to escape with.", "id": "13nxtpc", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/13nxtpc/cryptid_chronicles/", "created_utc": 1684682721.0, "score": 1, "permalink": "/r/flashfiction/comments/13nxtpc/cryptid_chronicles/", "comments": ["Will be posting this as a series, Cryptid Chronicles; bleeding myth into our 'modern' life.", "Yup currently working on limiting word count and making it coherent.

You might as well do what you can, while you can.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not dead *yet*,\u201d I repeated. He rolled his eyes at me.\n\n\u201cLook. Plank and Duggins are in. If you want to get high, come to my house before the party.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m on the fence about it.\n\nWhen I got home, my mom was on my case about grades. I do fine. She thinks I could be doing more. She\u2019s always going on about my future and how I need to work hard and that Peter is a bad influence. She always has to be right. If I told her what Pete showed me at school, she\u2019d have a stroke\u2026\n\nMy dad keeps a good lawn. The ground is nice and soft. I could lay out here all day in the sun. My neck is kind of stiff, though. And my eyes hurt from staring. But I can\u2019t risk missing something. I know I\u2019m right about this.\n\nIf grass *could* move, most people probably couldn\u2019t even tell. If it moved, what would that even look like? It\u2019s not something people think about. So when it happens, they don\u2019t notice it at all.\n\nA blade of grass might give a wave or a jump and you just assume it\u2019s the wind\u2014a breeze that you didn\u2019t even feel. But you know it\u2019s there. The grass just moved after all.\n\nOr maybe when you start the lawn mower, the grass feels that rumble and leans away as much as it can. But you just figure it\u2019s the blow of the mower and start choppin\u2019 heads line it\u2019s nothing.\n\nI know what I saw, though. I\u2019m laying out here in broad daylight, back to the sun trying to get a tan, completely zoned out staring at this one blade of grass beside me like a skyscraper sticking up over the horizon.\n\nAnd the blade of grass, it just\u2026stretches up. Just a hair. Just enough for me to see it. Maybe it wanted me to see it.\n\nI\u2019m not too familiar with the anatomy of grass, but I know we cut grass and it still lives, so we\u2019re obviously not cutting off anything too important. The blades of grass are just an extension of the roots, like an octopus\u2019 tentacles.\n\nThe interesting thing about grass is that it releases a hormone when it\u2019s cut. The sweet smell of fresh cut grass is really the sour smell of anxiety. Plants respond to their environments in all kinds of ways. Isn\u2019t that what consciousness is? Responding to your environment? At least, that\u2019s what doctors say. \u201cIs he responsive?\u201d\n\nI know we use that word, consciousness, like it\u2019s this deep, mystical thing. Like it\u2019s something that can\u2019t be defined\u2014a soul or something that connects us to a higher power. Maybe it\u2019s simpler than that. Maybe we have a complex version of what started off as a very simple thing. A thing that every living being has. And we\u2019re stuck trying to define the complex version of the thing without defining the thing itself. What do I know?\n\nA strong breeze blew and the blade teased me.\n\nThat\u2019s when I saw Sarah Dover walking up the road in the corner of my eye. She was walking her dog. Sarah lived up the block my whole life. I never really noticed her until this year.\n\nI sat up on my beach towel in the middle of my front lawn, leaning back on my hands. Boxer was taking his time sniffing the curb as they walked past our house. I stretched out my arm and gave her a big wave, like an air traffic controller with those goofy orange lights.\n\n\u201cHi, Matt,\u201d she said, waving back.\n\n\u201cHey, Sarah,\u201d I replied. \u201cYou going to Becca\u2019s party tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it. Are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to go with Pete and all them. I don\u2019t know if I really want to.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. Boxer pulled on the leash, but she stayed put.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d she asked. \u201cTanning?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, getting a nice tan for the summer. Watching grass grow. It\u2019s a new hobby of mine. Very exciting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWatching grass grow?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah. I read it in Bees and Trees Magazine,\u201d I joked. \u201cIt\u2019s full of stuff like that.\u201d She laughed.\n\n\u201cI bet,\u201d she replied. \u201cI was reading Handyman\u2019s Monthly and watching paint dry was the top suggested hobby. Maybe you could do that next.\u201d I laughed.\n\nBoxer pulled at the leash again.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d I said. \u201cHow about we go to the party together?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cThat sounds fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cCool. I\u2019ll swing by your place at seven. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nShe waved bye and I watched her walk off. I looked down at the grass beside me.

The black muzzle led the way through the door, perfect in the roundness of its flash suppressor, only echoed by the smaller, darker circle at its center.\n\nStanding in the rainbow interior of the juice shop, its bright florescent lights turning every reflective surface into chrome, Jacob\u2019s tall frame was elongated in the funhouse mirror of the entrance as it swung open.  He wouldn\u2019t have even glanced it that direction if he hadn\u2019t been staring at the checkout girl.  Prenessa was her name and Jacob had been timing his visits to the shop, more or less successfully, to match her schedule.  On first seeing her, he had been enchanted by everything from her braids to the soft cocoa of her skin.  He learned quickly, though, that she didn\u2019t backed down from anything, whether it was that screaming middle-aged mom or the asshole with the Confederate flag tattoo.  To Jacob, Prenessa was tough, smart enough to be bored with her shit job, and would occasionally grace him with a smile like the sun coming out.\n\nAs she brought listless eyes up from the register to the next customer, Jacob hoped she might see him.  Instead, she glanced at the opening door next to him and her eyes widened as someone whose worst fears had been confirmed.  Jacob ceased admiring her hard beauty at the almost instantaneous change.\n\nAfter that, everything fell away, and there was only the gun.  Jacob didn\u2019t know much about firearms, but he knew that even in Constitutional Carry states like his, you didn\u2019t walk around with your rifle unslung.  Now here was one walking in through the mirrored front door, barrel raised, pointing into the shop\u2019s bright and multi-colored interior.Jacob hadn\u2019t thought much about what he would do in what the news consistently referred to as an \u2018active shooter\u2019 situation.  What thoughts he\u2019d had mostly revolved around hoping he wouldn\u2019t be in one.  Here he was now, though, at the end of a long line of people waiting to get their juice, arranged like so many paper targets, with the tough Prenessa too far away to do anything, too petrified to even duck behind the counter.  From somewhere, Jacob heard laughter.\n\nWith the door chime still echoing, Jacob reached out and grabbed the barrel behind the front sight, and yanked as hard as he could, pivoting with the weight of all of his body.  He pulled the rifle into the store, dragging a scrawny and scruffy white dude with it, still attached to the gun by its sling.  The man\u2019s smaller size allowed Jacob to swing around, skittering him across the tile floor.\n\nThe rifle was better maintained than its owner, clean and well-fed, not a speck of dirt on it with a sizable magazine.  Jacob grabbed its other end by the stock and launched a kick into its owner\u2019s crotch.The well-aimed blow crunched into the man\u2019s testicles, doubling him over.  As he collapsed with a groan, Jacob tore the rifle from him.  The moment blurred and yells issued from beyond the adrenaline bubble that Jacob now inhabited.\n\nThen there was an aspirated sound like driving out of a tunnel and Jacob seized.  Something slapped into his back, hard and paralyzing like the ice ball a mean-spirited Michigan cousin had hit him with many years ago.  He reached for the impact point on his back, but his fingers wouldn\u2019t obey his commands, spasming into pained claws as his shoulders contorted, bending towards each other.The juice shop lost whatever magic had been holding it in place and tilted, sliding away.\n\nThe soft landing on the other man was what told Jacob he had fallen, rolling over so his vision was dominated by the firmament of the shop\u2019s water-stained and cratered cardboard ceiling.That moonscape was breached by another gun, another long rifle coming into view before the portly fellow wielding it followed.  Eyes filled with a fear that mirrored Prenessa\u2019s, he stared into Jacob\u2019s still open eyes as he yelled, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?  I told you to stop!\u201d\n\nThe man jerked like a hunted animal that caught a scent on the wind and raised his eyes back to the crowd.  He swung the rifle around as he yelled, \u201cYou saw him!  That crazy nigger attacked my friend!\u201dJacob\u2019s chest felt very cold while his back felt warm and wet.  He tilted his head to see the store\u2019s patrons scattered, some hiding behind furniture, others circling to avoid the swaying rifle.  \u201cYou dumb asshole,\u201d someone screamed, \u201cdid you think the Taliban airdropped terrorists inta here?\u201d\n\nThe second gunman shouted back, shrieking for the crowd to shut up, and leaned over to look past Jacob to his downed friend.  From behind him, a smaller pair of arms appeared to wrap themselves around the man\u2019s neck, locking under his beard to drag him out of Jacob\u2019s narrowing field of vision.  There may have been more gunshots, or maybe people banging into furniture, but he could only hear a faint and distant struggle.\n\nIt didn\u2019t concern Jacob, though.  He felt the warm love of God coursing from him, covering him and the man under him, and he wondered why his chest, pointed towards Heaven, felt so cold.\n\n[www.matthewcmclean.com](http://www.matthewcmclean.com)", "id": "13jzgbm", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/13jzgbm/the_slain_redeemer/", "created_utc": 1684324148.0, "score": 1, "permalink": "/r/flashfiction/comments/13jzgbm/the_slain_redeemer/", "comments": [], "URLs": ["http://www.matthewcmclean.com)"], "html_title": ["NA"]}, {"title": "I Shrunk Myself", "selftext": "See, I built a shrinking machine, and I shrunk myself down to the size of an ant\u2019s thorax.

Grandma will love them!\u201d\n\nThumping grew closer, and I felt myself ripped away from the only home I had known, squished between a warm stickiness I didn\u2019t understand, handled with no regard to my peace. \n\nI hated all of that movement, noise. I hated it so much, my body began to droop, until, \n\n\u201cHi mom, Katie saw these flowers on the side of the road, and she really wanted to bring you some.\u201d\nAnd the warmth I\u2019d been feeling was suddenly replaced by something much colder, but at least the stickiness was gone.\n\nThe coldness was, however, quickly replaced with wetness, much like what came from above, before, but now it was all below me, surrounding my lower body, making me feel out of place. But at least I was still again.\n\nThe light didn\u2019t pass the same here. It stayed around too long, stayed bright all the time. And this wetness, it wasn\u2019t nourishing me. My body no longer wanted to expand like it did before. It only exhausted itself trying. I knew I was dying. Until, \n\n\u201cHenry, throw those wilting flowers out to the birds, would you?\u201d\n\nI finally found myself back underneath the light I had been longing for, except this time, it was no real comfort to me. I was still dying nonetheless, being dried out quicker by its heat, gaining no moments of mercy, before I found myself being torn apart, scattered. This was not the stillness I wanted.\n\nUntil darkness met me again, not death, but the same timeless darkness as before, and just as before, soon enough, I burst forth and found that brilliant light anew, along with the others, and I was filled with gratitude, until, \n\n\u201cMargie, they\u2019re beautiful; you\u2019ve done such a wonderful job.\u201d\n\nI knew what came next, what that sound meant.\n\nExcept...\n\nThis time, the warmth came, but soft and tender, only pulled away the things that seemed to want to choke me. When the wetness refused to come from above, that sound brought it to me, along with something it called songs. \n\nAnd now, even though I have found that darkness many, many times, every time I find my way back out, that sound still returns, calling me things like beautiful, and lovely, and although I do not understand what they mean, I do understand that they fill me with warmth. And I do know that when that sound comes, I always hear, \u201cThank you,\u201d even though it only asks me for stillness.", "id": "137vgzu", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/137vgzu/lifecycles/", "created_utc": 1683224529.0, "score": 1, "permalink": "/r/flashfiction/comments/137vgzu/lifecycles/", "comments": ["Great point of view.

Mourners huddled under black umbrellas, their eyes glassy with unshed tears.\n\nJane stood in the front row, her grip on the umbrella handle as steady as her resolve. She'd been Mr. Thompson's neighbor for the past six years, but they'd only exchanged pleasantries in passing. It was a mystery to her why she was named the sole beneficiary of his will, receiving not only his estate but also the sealed envelope clutched in her trembling hand.\n\nAs the eulogy came to a close, the mourners dispersed, leaving Jane alone by the grave. She couldn't shake the feeling that Mr. Thompson had entrusted her with something significant. Her curiosity finally got the better of her, and she tore open the envelope, revealing a single sheet of paper.\n\nJane's eyes scanned the hastily scrawled words. Her heart raced as the story unfolded in her mind. Mr. Thompson, a retired history professor, had discovered an unsolved mystery during his research. He'd stumbled upon a missing artifact from an ancient civilization, an object rumored to have immense power.\n\nHowever, he'd also unearthed a secret society determined to protect the artifact and its secrets. As a result, Mr. Thompson had lived in fear for his life, knowing he'd become their target. By naming Jane as the beneficiary, he'd hoped to pass on the responsibility of finding and protecting the artifact to someone unassuming and unconnected to his work.\n\nAs Jane finished reading, she noticed a small map tucked into the envelope. It marked a remote location in the Andes mountains, presumably where the artifact was hidden. She looked around nervously, feeling the weight of the responsibility suddenly thrust upon her.\n\nJane made her decision. She would honor Mr. Thompson's wishes and protect the artifact from those who sought to misuse its power. She folded the letter, tucking it securely into her coat pocket, and walked away from the cemetery with a newfound purpose.\n\nAs she left, a figure in a dark trench coat emerged from the shadows, watching her retreating form. The figure pulled out a phone and dialed a number.\n\n\"Mr. Thompson's plan worked,\" the figure said in a low, gravelly voice. \"The girl has taken the bait. We shall proceed as planned.\"\n\nWith that, the figure disappeared into the rain, leaving the cemetery with a silence broken only by the gentle patter of raindrops.", "id": "137u7cg", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/137u7cg/the_last_words_of_mr_thompson/", "created_utc": 1683221737.0, "score": 7, "permalink": "/r/flashfiction/comments/137u7cg/the_last_words_of_mr_thompson/", "comments": ["Hello everyone!

Sea. Stone. That was the essence of this place, unfinished by God and then cast away to an especially desolate ocean. It was all giant, broken cliffs and menacing mountains swept bare by furious winds. What little that did grow was hard and harsh, stubby shelled plants clinging to usually frozen soil. Of the animals, people knew little and saw less, and more than a few sailors whispered amongst themselves that whatever lived here could not be natural, instead having been the transformed remnants of ancient castaways made into beasts. At night, when the Moon came from behind so much cloud to scowl at them in silvery silence, there were long howls. \n\nThat first night it played, a lone music on a place that only yesterday had endured ceaseless millennia in a natural silence. The notes drifted and echoed, danced up mountain sides, fell into the foaming black water. It was like a reverential tombs silence broken, and all those newly arrived souls sat in their chilly beds. Listening to the notes, to the wind prying at their wooden walls with an eagerness to send them all flying back from whence they\u2019d come. \n\nIt played, night after night. Night after night, moonlit or dark and cloud-drowned, came the piano from the Governor. It came in the nights after the days even when he had gone unseen, his whereabouts among so much dark rock and low lying growth unknown. The piano played. \n\nThe piano played, too, on the night warships came under the cover of blackness. \n\nThe piano played as everyone fled, the town burning in raging flames that ate up all the meager achievements they\u2019d accomplished, like it had never existed in the first place.

During  this punctilious ritual, he would decide how he would tend to the grass  around his home, checking for weeds and varmints, and make plans for a  garden he never seemed to start.\n\nMost days the sun was bright and he happily  worked in the lawn. He only tended the cottage\u2019s immediate vicinity, for  the grass stretched out around his home in a vast sea of green,  unblemished by neighbors, roads, or trees. He was uncertain as to how he  had arrived at this state of affairs, for he had no recollection of  arriving there. This didn\u2019t concern him, though.\n\nMost days this was true until the buzzing  started. It would begin somewhere beyond the horizon, then rise like an  unseen cloud, moving towards his home. Then he would sigh, and  straighten up on creaking knees, and move back into the house. There  he\u2019d prepare tea for the strangers he knew would be arriving shortly.\n\nMost days, the visitors were shades that would  swirl about his home. They would ask questions about his well-being and  his memory, but he didn\u2019t care for their intrusions. He smiled and  nodded, their questions becoming an incessant bombination that would  only cause him to hope they would leave. Eventually their noise would  reach a crescendo and they would finally vanish as quickly as they had  arrived. The silence that followed always left behind a bubble in his  ears and an empty ache in his bones.\n\nMost days it went on like this, but some days,  after washing his hands and scrubbing his face, he caught a glimpse of  himself in the mirror, a dark face going to gray, with bags under its  eyes, hair receding from the temples. He would find himself transfixed  by the image of a much younger man interposing itself. The young man who  lived in a countryside village, raised by a loving couple, amongst  friends and neighbors, who grew up exploring the woods around the town.  Under the forest\u2019s canopy of leaves, he planned a future with so many  possibilities he could hardly choose between them. Until the buzzing  sounded, like no other insect, with lights weaving between the patches  of sky, moving as randomly as a child\u2019s sparkler, closer and brighter  until he was blinded. Then there, on the forest floor, revealed as the  veil of darkness was peeled back, a small house. Like a home of a  Victorian doll, it was intricate and detailed, made all the more strange  by its appearance of always having been there, its base covered in the  same green moss as the forest floor, its perfection only ruined by the  buzzing issuing forth.\n\nThose days, he tore his gaze from the mirror  by shaking himself so strongly he might have been breaking the hold of  an attacker. He turned then, in the dark, reaching for the bathroom\u2019s  doorknob, jamming his fingers into the solid wood of the door, grasping  his pained fingers as a child might, staring into the dark as if the  door had betrayed him. After a time, he tentatively reached out to what  he knew was in front of him, a solid wooden door, with a single doorknob  on the left, its hinges on the right. He placed the palm of his  uninjured hand on the smooth wood of the door, above where he knew the  doorknob was, and slid his hand down. On that slow descent, his hand  encountered nothing but the long, vertical grain of the wood.\n\nForgetting the pain of his knuckles, he pawed  at the door, searching where he knew the knob should be, hands straying  into the dark to search areas the doorknob simply couldn\u2019t be. As his  heartbeat began to thunder, his fingers would find the door\u2019s seam,  searching along it for some space, some handhold, a place he could pry  it open, only ceasing to search for the doorknob again, blindly hoping  that it might somehow reappear. When neither wood nor seam of the door  yielded anything, he would pull at the hinges until his fingernails were  reduced to bloody splinters.\n\nCovered in sweat and panic, he would attack  the door, kicking and punching it, only bruising knuckles and cracking  bones on its immutable surface. This clatter of this was only broken by  the buzzing sound returning, emanating from every corner of the room  until he had to stop his assault on the door to press his palms to his  temples, falling to his knees. In the piercing clarity of that moment he  could hear the questions.\n\n\\[Identity?\\]\n\n\u201cGo away.\u201d\n\n\\[How maintain existence with knowledge of corporeal dissipation?\\]\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\n\\[Function of dissolution?\\]\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\n\\[With mono view of time/space manifold, selection of future choices?\\]\n\n\u201cI just want to tend the grass!\u201d\n\n\\[Measurement of accomplishments within species\u2019 limited confines?\\]\n\n\u201cLet me go!\u201d\n\n\\[Is function of regret?\\]\n\nThe questions would continue, like mandibles  burrowing into his brain, until a scream boiled out of him, issuing from  a space so primal that it banished the mechanical arthropod buzzing and  the voices that issued forth. Their sudden withdrawal pulled the bones  out of his body and he would collapse on the bathroom floor, slipping  into unconsciousness on the cool tiles. When he awoke, the room would be  bright with daylight, the doorknob visible in its rightful place. He  would grasp it, grateful when it turned in his hands, wanting to get  away from the mirror and the buzzing. He didn\u2019t have the answers to  their questions.\n\nMost days he didn\u2019t think about them.\n\nYou can hear an audio reading of [the story here](https://matthewcmclean.com/2023/04/26/most-days/).", "id": "130ivf8", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/130ivf8/most_days/", "created_utc": 1682594894.0, "score": 4, "permalink": "/r/flashfiction/comments/130ivf8/most_days/", "comments": [], "URLs": ["https://matthewcmclean.com/2023/04/26/most-days/)."], "html_title": ["Not Acceptable!"]}, {"title": "Sarah", "selftext": "Sarah walked home after her appointment with her doctor.

Streaks of lights dance across the skies as He once used to when the band played ferociously into the hours where women and men alike would abandon their lust to beat the floorboards senseless. And of course, He smiles at that thought: the very idea that He was once beckoned by women, clothed up to their bosoms in lazily drawn attire, to dance the night away until the sunlight stabs the night sky like a thief who got his keep. He reconciles with His past failures and the convictions that once kept Him from enjoying a life so true to one\u2019s passions; however, it is the notion that He could not take on a lover that brings Him back to reality: the lonely leather seat that will be His last chair ensnared to the same spot in a room coated with a thick layer of dust. And with the boisterous clap of thunder, came the bitter taste of almonds.\n\nHe chokes and He violently seizes in agony before falling still into a deep slumber. The armrests held so tightly now hold His loosened grip and the breath once trapped within His lungs escape the confines of His weary body. The candlelight remains and the shadows of heavy clutter flick around the room as lively as He once was when He was young and desirable. Objects kept to their same positions now dance and leap around the walls in volleys with the floating dust being their antithesis. How surreal it must have been to see the light penetrate the gentlest of things so profusely that their shadows lay still across a party of shadows sashaying to the instruments of the candlelight.\n\nAnd while there were no fine young men dancing amongst half naked women, this ball amongst the furnitures\u2019 shadows was all too lively to be disregarded. God too saw fit to enhance this jubilee, for even the thunder would land at all the right times to excite a number with immense intensity. The sound of the rain on the windowpanes too was a welcomed guest by the band as the shadows remained undisturbed. \n\nIn an instant, the blackened figures began to shrink\u2014folding and dancing deep into the night under a moon that glided across the ebony sky. The songs of the candlelight now grew amongst the walls, blaring great music as it scorched the mahogany. But as the light continued to bleed across the room, as the flames continued to grow, the shadows were then eaten away by the music they once danced to. What once was a beautiful melody now shrieks and pops and cackles with the howls of the outer tempest being all too persistent. And from a great distance, no one can hear the fiddle play or see the shadows dance; however, they can surely see the thick smoke, and where there is smoke there is always a great fire.", "id": "1308zwy", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1308zwy/an_unfortunate_conclusion/", "created_utc": 1682567475.0, "score": 2, "permalink": "/r/flashfiction/comments/1308zwy/an_unfortunate_conclusion/", "comments": [], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "Outside of Town", "selftext": "His own lust was the hook, even if her heart-shaped ass baited him.
