But there's a difference between them. In the comment, OP said they were \"incredibly offended\" by the journalist assuming a low-caste identity. In the academic text, Ambedkar was quoted as saying that black Americans and low-caste Indians have something in common, which I assume to be a low social status mandated by a pre-existing social structure. Why should OP be offended by a black American borrowing the term low-caste to describe themselves?\n\n> I would urge you to have a more nuanced perspective on this issue than \"either any comparisons between American blacks and 'untouchables' is objectionable, or the comparison the book is making is quite alright.\" OP did not suggest that, and I certainly don't think Ambedkar suggested that.

Hurting someone just for the sake of hurting them is wrong. There's a difference between poking someone with a needle and punching them in the face, but the extent does not determine the underlying moral status of the act. If there is something inherently offensive in comparing the plight of black Americans and 'untouchables', it's wrong regardless of extent. Which is why I felt it would be useful to make the trivial comparison.\n\n> For instanced, an intelligent, informed comparison built on knowledge of the relevant issues and drawn in a way that offers a helpful perspective would be okay, whereas an unintelligent, uninformed comparison built on large amounts of ignorance of the relevant issues and drawn in a way that reinforces existing prejudices would not be okay.\n\nWhat is an intelligent comparison? What is an unintelligent comparison? Why is intelligence even relevant? Would an 'intelligent' eugenicist with a vast knowledge of the matter provide a less harmful comparison than an 'unintelligent' civil rights advocate with a comparably shallow understanding?\n\nI agree that journalists should do whatever they can to get things right. Misunderstandings and other errors are valid reasons why we should lend less credence to their work.

If a statistical model is too simple, it will suffer from underfitting. Too complex, and it will be overfitting. The optimal level of complexity depends on what you want to use the model for. If errors can have dramatic consequences, as with self-driving cars, you better make its model as accurate as possible. If errors are relatively benign, as with content recommendation, the cost of accuracy outweighs its benefits.\n\nI came across [this piece](https://thewire.in/books/book-review-isabel-wilkerson-caste-racism-america) on Wilkerson's book which I found to be illuminating. It's written by an Indian-American social scientist who presents a balanced perspective. In contrast to OP's comment I take (almost) no issue with anything he writes.\n\n> I must raise one other question, since Wilkerson expends a great deal of effort to show why the similarities between caste in India and race in the US are so striking, so relevant and so much more important than the differences. My question is this: if caste in the US is a kind of code, which is buried deep under the surface of race (and of the brutal etiquette and institutions of race and racism), how can we compare it to a society like India, where caste is both the code and the everyday reality? Put another way, either India has no underlying social programme, grammar and theory, and its social world is simply caste all the way up and down (something I doubt), or Wilkerson\u2019s dramatic unearthing of caste under the surface of race in the US is just a literary device to tell a familiar American story in an unfamiliar way, and is not based on a genuine similarity.\n> \n> I lean towards the latter reading.\n\nMy only (minor) gripe is that similarity is inherently relative. Seeing social structures as adaptive and self-perpetuating, shaped and maintained by its inhabitants, means that status is perpetually negotiated and entrenched with various groups enjoying the perks of being at the top while others suffer at the bottom. In that sense, arguing for similarities seems fairly reasonable. Old and rigid systems will be different from younger ones but they are similar in the sense that old and young people are both, well, *people*.\n\nIf Wilkerson's aim was to present racism as a special case of a more general phenomenon I don't think there's anything wrong with using caste as her chosen literary device for doing so. It would, perhaps, have been better to employ a scientific lens rather than basing it all on another special case. For instance, she could have described oppressive social structures as complex adaptive systems. Political scientists Frank R. Baumgartner and Bryan D. Jones did something like this in *Agendas and Instability in American Politics*, viewing policy change through the lens of evolutionary biology and Gould's theory of punctuated equilibrium. They are, however, academics and they wrote a scholarly work. I wouldn't expect something like that from a journalist.", "What's wrong with diminishing the caste system? It's a self-perpetuating adaptive societal system like so many others. It variously dehumanizes and celebrates individuals for belonging to and being molded by social structures, which is a phenomenon deserving of criticism.\n\nIt's perfectly fine to appropriate cultural terms when discussing a culture and using the word they use themselves to describe their own culture.

There's a whole range of people who would be able to get by more or less 'all right', who are pushed out of this middle ground.\n\nE.g. probably someone like OP who doesn't seem to want to buy a single-family home with a car etc. \n\nI can only imagine that a hell of a lot of the people in these homeless shelters surrounded by people with various behavioural issues probably gain mental health issues simply by being in that situation. I could easily see myself becoming distrusting and violent or turning to drugs if I lived like that. \n\nAnd your point about illegal affordable housing is spot-on. Yeah I know people talk about the state providing housing for people in the form of some sort of charity - but I think long before we need to discuss what sorts of social-welfare things the state might provide, let's start with just making it *legal* to build for-profit affordable housing! \n\nIf there were affordable apartments and walkable areas, suddenly it doesn't seem so crazy to let someone live on their own. And it's certainly more affordable.\n\nLike, trying to solve the problems of someone with inherent severe mental health issues is a hard ask. Even something as straightforward as popping cash into their hands doesn't actually help a lot of the time and there are all sorts of moral question around things like that too.\n\nBut I really think that the scale of the problem would be massively reduced if we just took simple steps like legalising the construction of affordable housing.", "I see your point and am interested in this book but what people seem to often fail to realize is these markets that catered to the lower class have been squeezed out by regulation and legal liability.

Well, despite this, [the homeless population keeps rising](https://sfgov.org/scorecards/safety-net/homeless-population), because more people enter homelessness than exit it.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why people become homeless, but first and foremost is the problem that they can't afford a home. And indeed, you get more homelessness in places where homes are more expensive. (People on the right will blame a lack of brutality or plush services, but it really is primarily the cost.) The cost of housing is extremely high because there's not enough of it, and various local incentives lead the people who control local land use to block housing in their own backyards, to the point where [subsidized (not even supportive) housing costs a million bucks a unit](https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2020-04-09/california-low-income-housing-expensive-apartment-coronavirus).\n\nThis all takes some [pretty twisty forms](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-left-nimby-canon) in practice, but the bottom line is the same.

It was something I slogged through. I see why the person thought it belongs on this sub but it's more useful as an insight into a mentally ill person's circumstances than it is a rational look at the effectiveness of the homeless system.\n\nThe issue he was raising was about mental health. He mentioned safety at the shlethers, so he could hypothetically get some more police presence there, but that's the only legitimate concern I really saw. If the police locks up everyone stealing, doing drugs, and doing violence, at those shelters, they would be in prison and the homeless shelters would be safe. \n\nI notice you judge the state of the homeless system in regards to your ideals. I judge the state of the homeless system in regards to where we are at.\n\nWhere we were at before, as he mentioned in his post, was the great depression, in which these little hostel-type homeless shelters arose. There will always be chaff that falls to the bottom, and environments catering to those people will always tend to be dangerous and/or involve poor mental health. Just having provided a homeless shelter at all is an act of help that was not required. \n\nBy providing the homeless shelters, people have taken it upon themselves to give up their own time and money for people who do not pursue money, so that they can have more time. \n\nSo, honestly, I think we should get rid of the homeless system and focus on land reform and mental health services.\n\nThe homeless shelters serve no purpose other than the outlet for people's charity. Homeless people in the city do drugs, if you're homeless just because you're out of luck, you wouldn't sleep in the city, it's really dangerous, you would sleep in the country, or otherwise work up a job that provides housing, or a work-stay program of which many are available and no qualifications are required. But they're mentally ill, and the mental health system is inefficient.\n\nPersonally I think your ideals are a bit off. A free life is a life well lived as far as outsider perspective. I don't judge others' life merit, I do judge that they're free to do as they wish though. I knew an alcoholic that had trouble with it his entire life, but he always kinda stuck with it, it was part of who he was. A lot of people looked down on him, and it's terribly sad to me that he had to endure this passive social rejection for his life choices which don't effect others. But our society is like that, and people see alcoholics as pitiful or bad or immoral or undeveloped. I just think he was a free human living his life and not hurting anyone. I loved the guy. \n\nIt's the same with the hobos, I don't lose respect for them by seeing the life they choose. I think it takes balls actually, but I just mostly  don't see it as pitiful like everyone else.\n\nUnless you are providing a long term improvement, even just a plan, to a person's life, then momentary relief like homeless shelters provide really does only serve as an outlet for charity. Logical inconsistency and the pathos of pity being the praxis for homeless shelters, it makes sense that they do not actually provide long term improvement and could be argued to be a pretty useless superifical show of charity.", "It's also worth mentioning for those concerned with costs, in places like NYC and the Bay area we currently spend about the same or more than the median income per homeless person.

Non addicted mentally ill get housed with addicted mentally ill and it creates nothing but problems and an unsafe space for the non addicts. I'd rather have a violent client than an addict personally because it's much easier to manage. Second component is that you can't treat the addiction without treating the mental illness, and while it may be reasonable to assume they are one and the same, they are not in practice. So mentally ill homeless rarely ever agree to engage in treatment for either issue. The choice then is to put a hold on them and get them to a facility where their movement is limited in the community and you can reasonably control their access to drugs. This works. It works REALLY WELL. I've seen it over and over again. But as society we've decided that a psychiatric hold is basically the devil and the clients rights are paramount in all cases. Which is nice and touchy feely, but helps almost no one and imo is a reactive throwback to when we chained the mentally ill to walls. So our hands are tied. \n\nThen you have the county and state fighting facilities to take clients that aren't appropriate for their facilities, making rules that govern denial to admission, and we have a revolving door of clients that trash and bring drugs into facilities, companies that provide mental health treatment barely able to stay in business because their funding is primarily engagement based and they are forced to take clients that don't engage in treatment, and staff watching people NOT get better because their hands are tied by the system. It's not a popular thing to say, but in my 20 years of experience, client outcomes when there's addiction and mental health issues involved are MUCH more positive when they are in a locked facility, or when the legal system is involved. Outreach programs in the community rarely work when addiction and moderate to severe mental health issues are involved. You may as well throw money in the garbage. \n\nFor me, the answer almost always is to go back to funding state hospitals (they're not one flew over the cuckoo's nest any more even though I think people still hold onto that image) and to restructure how providers are paid to untie funding from treatment engagement. It's HARD, at least in my state, to keep a company afloat, provide the care you set out to provide, and to pay staff to keep them around doing the incredibly hard work they do, when the mental health industry gets scrutinized an order of magnitude more intensely funding wise than any other medical field. \n\nFun side note, my company and our nearest competitor have currently 200+ job openings. Why? Because our state funding structure is so fluid we can't pay enough to get people in the door. And we pay well comparatively for our industry. Our state hospital called in the national guard because they had such a severe staffing shortage. We have contracts to open multiple small facilities and so does our competitor and we can do nothing about it because we have no staff.", "That's reasonable to say, but I can also see someone reasonably lamenting damage done to a property from neglect, or dangers to neighbors.\n\nI mean, half of the things OP complains about are directly a result of other people in the shelter doing drugs. If you were homeless and just housed, perhaps trying to get away from that stuff, and a drug addict was housed next door to you, it would kind of suck.\n\nPerhaps it's still a net positive to house 2 people, rather than housing one person in an environment away from all the things that OP is complaining about, but I can definitely see why it might not be so clear.\n\nRegardless, if there were a significant percentage fewer people in the situation to begin with, because they are homed in the private market due to a greater availability of lower income housing, I think we can all agree that that would be unambiguously better", "*Oh*.

He started a movement to remove and replace with the mental institutions and stopped after the \"remove\" process. Well funded institutions with for people with mental health issues, and separate similarly funded institutions for people with addiction would be a huge step, and in the long run even if only a portion are successfully rehabbed it will save us money because it will reduce resources spent long term on unhealthy people who can then become part of the normal tax base.", ">  It's not a popular thing to say, but in my 20 years of experience, client outcomes when there's addiction and mental health issues involved are MUCH more positive when they are in a locked facility, or when the legal system is involved.

Some of them are just nazis.\n\nOthers are talking about the structure of the Nazi government. Hitler was an effective orator, but that's about it. He had precisely zero aptitude or desire to administer a bureaucracy, which what a chief executive's (whether you're talking about a country or corporation) primary job responsibility is. Most of his governance was oral, vague, and second hand. For instance, there's a diary excerpt from one of his reports (Himmler? Goebbels?

No German soldiers ever faced capital punishment for refusing to murder Jews because it wasn't one of the Fuhrer's directives, it was the order of some lower officer. Soldiers who refused to kill Jews may have been demerited or sent to the front, but never faced harsh punishments for it. If German soldiers were being severely punished in meaningful numbers for refusing to commit genocide you could argue that they didn't have a choice. But they weren't.

Amazon claims that they do not \u201ccommingle\u201d stock from sellers\u2014whether this is always true is another story.\n\nWhat I do know is that brands make test purchases from specific sellers, and when counterfeit goods are received, that seller is who gets punished. That system doesn\u2019t work if commingling is the norm.\n\nI specialize in finding and removing counterfeit goods from online marketplaces, and while I am sometimes hesitant to purchase things on Amazon, I still do. Here\u2019s my advice on how to do that as safely as possible:\n\n* If the value of the product is highly correlated to the brand itself, as with luxury items, designer clothing, etc. I would advise buying direct from that brand or a brick-and-mortar retailer.\n\n* Don\u2019t automatically purchase from the default \u201cbuy box\u201d seller. This placement is determined by an aggregate of factors\u2014primarily lowest price (including shipping) but also shipping time, stock on hand, and seller rating. Competition is fierce for this position, and sellers use automated price adjustments to undercut other sellers by a penny, because that can be enough to win that spot.\n\n* The safest sellers are Amazon themselves\u2014\u201cSold by Amazon, Shipped by Amazon\u201d. Many brands sell products directly to Amazon, and those products are found with that combination. There is still the possibility that you may receive a counterfeit product, but Amazon will accept the return without question, and likely resolve the situation appropriately (for you as the consumer).\n\n* The next safest option is to purchase from an account associated with the brand itself, and fulfilled by either Amazon or the brand directly. The risk here is that just because a seller name matches a brand name, there is some potential for impersonation. Always check the details for brand name sellers to make sure they have a good rating and to see that their storefront page looks official\u2014legit brand storefronts will have custom \u201cmarquee\u201d images and catalog options. A big red flag is if you see a brand name account offering unrelated products.\n\n* The riskiest, but not always bad option is to buy from a third-party seller who is also handling fulfillment. I still occasionally purchase from these sellers if they are the only option, and the product I\u2019m buying is something inexpensive and generic\u2014where little insensitive exists to ship counterfeit products (things that are mass produced in China, like garden supplies, simple kitchen utensils, etc.)\nI never purchase expensive products, or those with delicate or complicated parts (most electronics) from sellers like this.", "That sub is seriously full of shit.

Not only do they charge $0.30 each, they are very apt to do it wrong, which can cause huge problems for sellers.\n\nFC workers also have a tendency to put returns back into sellable inventory that have been opened, used and may be missing parts.

Got your listing suspended because Amazon mis-labeled your inventory? Or maybe they suspended you for selling used or inauthentic products because the FC workers put too many of your used and/or defective products back into sellable inventory?

The North, which had nothing to gain, was pressing its views on the South, which had everything to lose. Southern churches withdrew, not to espouse pro-slavery doctrines, but to avoid any further agitation on the subject.\n\nSlavery was not really an issue among Southern Baptists themselves. It was an established fact. The institution was not considered a theological or moral question. To Northern ministers, the outlook was different. Living further from slavery, they subjected it to stricter scrutiny and found it to be contradictory to such fundamental Christian doctrines as the Golden Rule.\n\nThe basic dispute, the morality of slavery, was irreconcilable. As long as the debate had centred on church organisation, moderates had remained in control. When the issue became slavery itself, attitudes polarised. Outspoken Northerners considered slavery a sin. Most Southern ministers did not. Compromise with sin was impossible.\n\nThough neither side could compromise morally, both feared the effects of the rupture on the congregations and on political leaders. If Christians could not remain united, they could hardly expect the preservation of more tenuous unions. A church schism could well stimulate political fissures.

A US representative said that the fear was that those who had disappeared were killed, which... yeah, that's a genuine concern considering what happened in Srbrenica. It's still not relevant, it wouldn't mean international crimes were not committed in Kosovo even if it were true, and it wouldn't preclude Kosovo's right to external right to self-determination as a result.\n\n> There are people who commit them, and it's there sole responsibility.\n\nState actors' conduct is attributable to the State. It can also engender individual criminal responsibility, but that's in addition to State responsibility, not instead of it.\n\n> First of all, this is only your opinion, this isn't actually part of any international law or agreement. It's not something that is part of international law.\n\nKosovo's declaration of independence was legal (see the ICJ's advisory opinion) and it fulfills and the requirements for Statehood. Moreover, Serbia hasn't exercised sovereignty over Kosovo for more than 20 years. Since the exercise of sovereign authority is essential to claims of sovereignty (Island of Palmas Arbitration), this also weighs against claims of continued sovereignty over territory.\n\nIn addition, self-determination is grounded in natural law, which also supports the concept of remedial external self-determination. Peoples are entitled to self-determination. This usually means self-determination within a State that fulfills its obligations to those people, which in turn confers sovereignty over those people on the State. When a State fails to carry out those obligations, as colonizing States did, the people whose right to self-determination has been breached gains the right to independence. This is what led the Canadian Supreme Court, in the most widely cited opinion on self-determination, to recognize external self-determination in three possible situations: 1) colonized peoples, 2) oppressed peoples, and potentially 3) people denied any representation in government. \n\nKosovo arguably falls under the latter two categories. Oppression certainly includes war crimes and crimes against humanity attributable to a State, and Albanians in Kosovo had had no voice in the Yugoslav government for several years even before the war broke out (see, e.g., HRW's *Under Orders* report for details on that). Thus, because Serbia broke its sovereign obligations to Albanians in Kosovo, they had the right to external self-determination. A majority of States have recognized Kosovo as a State (https://www.bmz.de/en/countries/kosovo), which also weighs in favor of the legality of the self-determination of its inhabitants.\n\n> And again, you have multiple instances of states not respecting their citizens, many instances of war crimes happening, yet Kosovo is the only \"country\" to unilaterally declare independence and be recognised as such. No other instance in world. Why?\n\nIt's impossible to explain why something doesn't occur. Rights are not obligatory, though, they are discretionary. Just because other peoples do not exercise a right that they have doesn't mean they do not have it, nor does it mean that other groups don't have it.\n\nIt's certainly true that the gravity of what happened when Yugoslavia broke up explains why Kosovo has obtained more international support than other peoples may have. But again, that doesn't mean the right to remedial external self-determination doesn't exist, it means the international community should do more to recognize it.\n\nI'm sure you disagree with all of that, so I'm going to stop replying now. Have a good day.", ">hasn't breached its obligations to Serbs in Kosovo in a way that would create a right of remedial external self-determination\n\nForgive me, but that's just your opinion, one very much not shared by Kosovo Serbs on the ground.\n\nThe current Kosovo state was formed by the KLA.

The number is a measure of how related the universe's rate of expansion is to the black hole's mass. At zero, it means there's no relation at all, and that's what old models assumed. However, this paper shows that the mass of a black hole and the expansion appear to be mathematically linked, and the link is some sort of exponential scaling factor. It's probably not as simple as \"if the black hole is 2x bigger, the universe around it is expanding at 8x the speed\" (2^3 times) but it's something similar to that. There's a mathematic link from one to the other, and the variable that measures the strength of the link appears to equal ~3.", "The mathematical link is just a theory. What the paper shows is that it appears the mass of some large black holes seems to grow faster over time at a rate that is not simply explainable by normal processes (things fall in to the black hole and it eats them). It then appeals to the theory previously described which says that if we assume black holes have something going on in the interior then actually they would gain mass as time passes in the universe's expansion. k=3 is an important number set on one hand by some technical arguments I didn't look into further, and on the other more interesting hand by the fact that if black hole masses scale proportional to a^3 (where a is cosmological time/distance), then given their density scaling at a^(-3) due to the fact that space is 3-dimensional, this would mean their mass-energy density stays constant due to the cancelation which is precisely the behavior which makes dark energy what it is", "So that means that not only does gravity warp spacetime, it might actually *create* it? That's wild.\n\nI wonder if this effect scales, or if there's a certain threshold of matter concentration at which the effect overcomes spacetime's expansion inertia, if there even is such a thing. Like, is there more space being generated around my body because I'm made of matter? Or is spacetime sort of elastic, and has a natural resistance to expansion, and matter needs to reach a watershed density to cause the expansion effect?\n\nHell, this could even be a massive leap forward in nailing down quantum gravitation!

Or maybe a better way to say it is, because of localized extremely high densities of matter. \n\nI mean, there's a sense in which red-shift suggests there's more \"there\" between distant objects as time passes, right? The universe is constantly expanding out in all directions at every point, unless I'm completely misunderstanding things.", ">It creates it in the sense there's an increase in the distance between objects (universal expansion) caused by the influence of gravitation.\n\nYeah but our intuitions here are not the best. In everyday life, our concepts of distance are always extrinsic, in the sense that the geometry and size of objects are always viewed given the fact that the object is truly embedded in an external world. Like, if an object grows in size or distances grow larger, we perceive this extrinsically in the sense that we are external to the object and can measure its growth in size.\n\nThis differs fundamentally from the expansion of the universe. Here, the expansion has to do with the intrinsic geometry of the universe... by definition the universe isn't embedded in some sort of external space. We make physical inferences based on our knowledge of cosmology to measure the expansion of the universe, but if you thought about it from a literal way you wouldn't be able to tell at all. Lay a ruler on spacetime, can you measure how much space is created over time? Obviously not, because the ruler itself would expand. You as a human observer wouldn't be able to point this out either (\"Hey, the markings on the ruler are getting farther apart\") because you yourself are expanding in the same sense as the rest of spacetime.\n\n>I mean, there's a sense in which red-shift suggests there's more \"there\" between distant objects as time passes, right?\n\nBasically my thoughts on this are that there isn't really more \"there\", because there is no external perspective from which to measure that there is more of anything. It's not that there is more space per se between objects as time passes, but that the very notion of space and distance itself changes with passing time. It's really rather hard to have intuition about the things IMO because in our everyday life we have no idea what it means to live in an intrinsically curved space and where the curvature of the space is dynamical (time-varying).", ">Lay a ruler on spacetime, can you measure how much space is created over time? Obviously not, because the ruler itself would expand. \n\nAre you certain of that? I'm pretty sure I've seen physicists address this as a misconception before, and it doesn't really make sense when you think about it\u2013not that the universe is obliged to make sense to us, of course.\n\nThe evidence that suggests the universe is expanding is the red-shift of light due to the Doppler Effect, right? If the universe were expanding the way you say, with objects themselves keeping pace with the universal expansion, then that would mean that the only thing affected by expansion would be light, and presumably gravity. It wouldn't make sense to say the universe is expanding then, but rather that travelling light becomes attenuated over time/distance. In other words, what we call \"universal expansion\" wouldn't seem to us to be a universal phenomenon, but rather a property of traveling light.\n\nI'm sure this paradox is resolved through some facet of special relativity that's far beyond my ken, though. I'm a pretty fart smeller, but I won't pretend to understand more than a smidgeon of this stuff.", ">It wouldn't make sense to say the universe is expanding then, but rather that travelling light becomes attenuated over time/distance.\n\nThis is indeed how you can view it. Ultimately a lot of these philosophical/intuitive explanations are quite difficult, especially when physicists aren't exactly clear about what it means to \"lay a ruler across the universe\". The difference depends ultimately on how you parameterize the coordinates you use to describe space-time, but what these coordinates actually \"mean\" in terms of some hypothetical ruler is a sticky situation. In relativity, space and time are on equal footing more or less, so whether we want to talk about the universe \"expanding\" or we want to talk about the speed of light \"increasing\", it doesn't matter.\n\n>In other words, what we call \"universal expansion\" wouldn't seem to us to be a universal phenomenon, but rather a property of traveling light.\n\nThere is no other way for us to observe things about the universe except indirectly by observing their travelling light, so as far as the physics goes we can't tell the difference (afaik). The speed of light is only constant in inertial frames, i.e., with no space-time curvature, but of course this is not true in the real universe where all mass curves spacetime.", "As an aside, from what little I can glean from this hypothesis, it seems to me like the rate of universal expansion should follow a sinusoidal curve. That would fit with our observation that the rate of expansion is increasing over time, but it should then slow at some point in the future.

Even if copyright was non-transferable, original artists would have the same incentives to go after those sorts of things.\n\n(To be clear, copyright absolutely should *never* have been made transferable or ownable by a large corporation. Nor should it have been extended to life terms. But those are different arguments.)\n\nPre-copyright, most art was funded through commissions or patronage relationships. Today, we can add crowdfunding to that list. The problem with all of these business models is that they shift the risk of artistic failure onto the person paying to have the art made. That is, if you pay for a commission and you don't like the result, you can't really get your money back, unless you didn't get the thing you paid for at all. Same for a kickstarter that delivers, but kinda sucks.\n\nCopyright lets you shift the risk of artistic failure *back* onto the artist. That is, if someone, say, makes a bad movie or song, *you don't have to pay to go see or hear it*. But the business model only works if society *actually* deprives itself of work that it has not paid for. And this also has to extend to anyone making creative reuses of that art, which is why we have very broad laws around derivative works. If you write a book, you don't only own that book, but also the sequels, translations, spin-offs, prequels, movie rights, and so on. Those are all instances in which, if not jealously protected in an utterly broken fashion, then society can side-step the whole \"no one watches until they've paid\" principle.\n\nHence why we have publishers winging about lost sales and free riders, in ways that sound inhumane and totalitarian, even when it's a hilariously niche derivative product like guitar tabs. Because *that's the rules of the game*. In fact, there's plenty of individual authors who have been just as weirdly protective of their work. For example, George R. R. Martin seems to think that fanfic authors are a threat to his creative freedom.\n\nFor the record, they *aren't*.\n\nBut that's mostly because when you make a work without permission, you don't get any ownership over it. If we changed the law to make, say, guitar tabs not require permission so that the RIAA can't sue MuseScore or Ultimate Guitar; then someone making an \"unofficial\" guitar tab could sue the person who wrote the original song. At least in the case where they also made an \"official\" tab. Because copyright works recursively - it protects both the original artists and the person making the derivatives.\n\nWhat people really want is a sort of \"codified largesse\" where you get to play in other people's sandboxes without being sued. Could we do that? *Maybe*. There are certainly derivative products where this is feasible - but those are also the ones most likely to already be explicitly allowed by some kind of blanket policy or license. For the case of guitar tabs, there isn't much that official and unofficial tabs can do to separate themselves from one another. Once I've gotten an 'unofficial' guitar tab for free, there's no reason for me to buy an official tab book later. So it'd be indistinguishable from just saying \"songwriters do not deserve to be paid for guitar tab books\".\n\nThis may not actually be an objectionable end result. But it does chip away at the heart of copyright to say that certain reuses (outside of fair use) shouldn't require a license. Again: the whole point is that society agrees to not enjoy the art until it's been paid for.

I think that's not very common anymore because it's probably almost never needed? But that's what FSD beta is like, it drives and you pay attention and can take over anytime by just holding the wheel a little tighter or hitting the brakes.\n\nIt doesn't take a few seconds to take over, you can basically just pretend you were driving and as soon as the car deviates from what you would do, you provide any input and you're in control. It takes a fraction of a second. But it's not like it's a relaxing feature, it's like you're helping teach a teenager to drive. And it actually has features that help provide more input:\n\n* You can hit the accelerator, which pretty much just says that it's safe to go. FSD beta is very cautious, especially if there's any pedestrians or bikers anywhere in the area, so sometimes you can just tell it that it's being too cautious and should just go\n* You can send a clip back to Tesla. For example, if it took a turn but it wasn't very smooth, you could let Tesla know to review that spot\n* You can adjust the set speed. It will try and follow the speed limit or will go slower if the road is narrow or crowded or visibility isn't as good, etc. But often the posted speed limit is wayyy below how fast people are actually driving, and so it makes sense to manually tell the car it's OK to go above the speedlimit, and that's data that Tesla gets too.\n\nIn terms of safety, I'd guess that FSD beta testing is roughly as safe as having a teenager with a learner's permit and a parent in the car. And probably somewhat safer since the 'parent' can take over immediately if necessary.", ">If the requirement is that an unengaged passive observer is attentive enough to avert catastrophic failure at every possible split second of a multi hour journey, then the system is fundamentally unsafe because that's not how humans work.\n\nThat's how driving works.

I don't have access to any private info the NHTSA or Tesla has, but based on all reporting and the complete lack of any investigation in to accidents or leaks about accidents or reports from any media outlet or complaints from any victims, or really anything, it seems like a pretty good bet there's been zero fatal accidents.\n\nHonestly I would've expected there to be some by now, just statistically speaking, maybe even if FSD wasn't at fault.

Even if it wasn't any safer than the average US driver, given the sheer number of people using it, and the huge number of miles driven, statistically it seems like there should've been fatal accidents that were reported and confirmed by now. Maybe there has been, and the regulatory agencies haven't commented on them or opened a public investigation (and there's been zero leaks or independent reporting or complaints)? But it seems unlikely.\n\nSo, given the publicly available data, it's not a ridiculous hypothesis that driving with FSD beta active is statistically speaking at least as safe as being in the car with an average US driver. And potentially somewhat safer, maybe even significantly safer, than average.\n\nThere's a lot of theories we could come up with to explain that, for example, maybe driving with FSD beta actually makes people pay more attention to the road and keeps people from being distracted while driving (which is definitely a major cause of accidents). Or maybe it largely prevents people from driving aggressively, which is another major cause of accidents. Or maybe it's actually just a safe driver most of the time, and taking over when it makes a mistake isn't that hard or dangerous? Or maybe it's a combination of a lot of complex factors.\n\nBut it seems like we don't need to rely on theories about how safe it *should be* from experts on the internet.

But it does occasionally do something that would be very dangerous if someone didn't take over. \n\nBut the argument is that the way the system is designed, the way it monitors drivers and keeps them engaged and the kinds of driving it can do and the way it drives, etc. is poorly designed. The argument is that it's built in such a way that it makes it unreasonably likely that a driver won't be able to prevent a dangerous mistake. That's a theory and so far the data doesn't seem to back it up.\n\n> The fact that drivers have been able to avert these incidents from causing a fatality so far, is lucky.\n\nThat's another theory, can you provide any evidence to support it? It would seem like if the system was really both poorly designed to keep drivers engaged and also made dangerous mistakes regularly that it would lead to a lot of serious and sometimes fatal accident. \n\nIt's been a couple years of testing, with hundreds of thousands of people driving for many millions of miles.

And California also made regulations that they can't market it as \"full self driving\"", "> Alphabet has the best self driving cars right now, full stop. So why aren't they public\n\nBut they are running a public service with driverless cars right now, in both Phoenix and SF. Waymo doesn't manufacturer cars to sell to the public, they're running an autonomous ride hailing company. But they definitely are running their cars on public roads, with regular people using them. And it's not like they're perfect and there's no testing or improvements happening.\n\n> They have enough capital that they can actually research\n\nI'm not sure I see the point of this claim, but let's clear up a few things:\n\n* Google spun out their self driving car business, and it's mostly owned by the parent company Alphabet. It's a separate company with their own CEO, their own profit and loss and their own capital and investors\n* Waymo has [raised capital from outside investors](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/16/tech/waymo-fundraising/index.html) a few times already, and it's very unlikely that they're profitable now, so they'll likely have to raise more\n* Alphabet leadership has been pretty clear that they're not just going to fund all their portfolio companies indefinitely and they need to either be profitable or raise outside investments\n\nSo Waymo hasn't gotten their tech to \"fruition\", even though their self driving taxis are very impressive, it doesn't seem like they can make a sustainable business out of it yet. And they would've run out of capital if they hadn't raised more from investors, and it seems reasonable that those investors would need to see some progress. For example, running a public ride hailing fleet without safety drivers, even if the technology isn't completely perfect yet.\n\nAnd actually, Tesla is in a pretty good spot financially because they have the entire car business to generate profits to fund R&D. They don't need to rely on selling self driving or a robotaxi service to keep the company afloat. They're also a very profitable company and so don't have any need to impress new investors and their R&D spending is so low compared to revenue that they really don't have any fear of running out of money.\n\nActually, they haven't even been recognizing most of the revenue from FSD as profit. Because they haven't delivered the product they promised, they can't recognize the sales as profit yet. They do recognize things like purchases of Enhanced Autopilot, where they're actually delivering the features now. And basic autopilot is standard, so part of the cost of buying the car goes towards paying for hardware like all the cameras and the computer that runs autopilot and FSD.\n\nCompared to the rest of the industry I think there's a lot of reasons to not be worried about Tesla's financial need to get FSD working. They're in great financial shape, have basically zero risk of bankruptcy, and have enough reserves that they're very unlikely to need to raise money or impress investors.\n\nCompare that to other self driving companies that are almost completely dependent on outside investors and a single technology to be profitable. There's already been large self driving companies that have shut down because they weren't making enough progress and were bleeding money, even if they had huge investors in the automotive industry like Argo.\n\nIt's not hard to see stories about Cruise's driverless cars doing weird things and causing huge traffic jams because they just stop in the road, and think that maybe they're rushing things a bit and having more people behind the wheel might be a good thing? Which isn't too say that Cruise's technology isn't hugely impressive. Just that from a financial perspective I don't think Waymo or Cruise are completely isolated from the need to show concrete progress to investors to stay in business.", "[removed]", "> If I worked for Tesla I would want to be paid to test the product\n\nRight, exactly. Tesla employs people who are dedicated product testers for FSD and Autopilot. A couple years ago there was a huge hiring push by Tesla to hire a lot more testers in cities all across the US, and even in cities in Canada and Europe (where they don't do any public testing of FSD).\n\nIf you check their job listing there's almost always a handful of open positions for ADAS test operators. I don't know if they're still expanding or if those are filling vacant positions or what, but it's obvious they have a lot of dedicated internal testers and have for years. These people apparently aren't allowed to post on YouTube or Reddit, so if some \"expert\" only knows what's on social media they might think that Tesla only uses members of the public for testing?

The system screams at the passenger when this happens. You have to be totally incoherent to miss these warnings. And again he had plenty of time to re-engage. It is a tool, like cruise control or lane assist and should never be treated as purely autonomous. The driver is always ultimately responsible.\n\nIt\u2019s not what I \u201cthink\u201d.

It's just clickbaity hyperbole. \n\nIn this particular linked video, by far the likeliest scenario is that the driver had it in autopilot, wasn't holding the wheel, autopilot flashes several warnings and loudly beeps for awhile to tell you to grab the wheel, then if you continue to ignore it the car pulls over and slows down. And yes, it probably malfunctioned and thought the left lane was a shoulder or something like that, and we probably won't know all the details until there's an investigation, but if the past is any indication the video will be front page news on the internet and the accident report will come out like \"oh yeah the driver was asleep in the back seat with a banana zip tied to the steering wheel to try to fool the sensors\" and will not get nearly as much publicity.", "It\u2019s at least five seconds.

We have a hard time in science making sure that the 'phenotype' or behaviors we see in people actually are caused by the 'genotype' or genetic differences we cite.

Height is affected secondly to the primary goals of the growth genes involved in limb and spinal column length that also affect other areas of development. Also epigenetic factors probably matter more for these areas, which are more subtle and even more difficult  to manipulate precisely.

Basically all their systems are very old and inadequate and they broke under the stress of the storm. \n\nAnd the linked post is saying all this is because the CEO is an accountant that can\u2019t be bothered to understand operations and has been ignoring the problem for a long time.", "Yes you framed it better", "From reading a bunch of comments and having been in the IT world, I think that the previous CEO is mostly to blame.

Now they need to get another flight attendant, because there are legal requirements for how many you have on the plane. Good news though, there\u2019s a flight attendant dead heading on a flight that came in who is able to step i to the open slot! You just need to get them listed on the flight and you can leave, all you need to do is make one phone call!\n\nYou and everyone else doing the same thing. Apparently, they aren\u2019t quick phone calls either. So you end up on hold. Meanwhile, the flight crew are only allowed to be \u201cworking\u201d for so many continuous hours (it\u2019s a safety thing, and a working conditions thing). But good news, you finally got through on the phone, and got your switch completed! Bad news, the rest of your flight crew timed out half an hour ago. Good news, there is an available flight crew from a canceled flight, you can get them on this one!

Even better, that assumes you are starting with a culture of producing results instead of producing good quarterly numbers. Twenty years of \u201cproduce good quarterly numbers!\u201d from upper management means every department is focused on that, instead of on being useful.

My understanding of the timing is that they have to get a certain amount of downtime each day, so if they would be in the air or land at a time that makes their downtime requirement impossible to achieve, they aren't allowed to take off.\n\nThat is what went wrong with a bunch of SW flights. Their crews were on hold so long they were all timing out, and then the airline was scrambling to assign or move new crews, which essentially led to a failure cascade since no one was able to get assignments processed in time to fly the planes. \n\nThis was compounded by the airline having pilots and crews move to planes only to discover there was no other flight or grounds crew available for the flight. That happened to my other friend. He got through to scheduling after his first fight was cancelled. They moved him to a flight in another city, so he jumpseated (rode on another airlines flight) over there to find there was no ground crew to load the plane.

Thanks", "I\u2019m confused by your request but here is the text of their comment:\n\n\u201cFirst, this is well beyond \"history\", and deep into prehistory and paleoanthropology, so sources here are based on fossil and genetic evidence. Our understanding of human evolution is constantly... well, evolving. There are also lots of new finds and controversies surrounding the dating of fossils and the strata in which they are found. Likewise, many of the most useful techniques are still being developed- tracing the changes in our genome and the appearance of genes at certain points, and their movement through populations. So let's explore the evidence and then try to put together a possible picture!\n\nLet's start with human speech, which may have played an important part in our own social evolution. Here, we can compare our own anatomy to those of our own cousins and see what precisely enables us to make the sounds we do, and see when those traits emerged in the fossil record.\n\nConsider the ability to produce human vowel vocalizations. Hyoid bones provide the point of attachment for tongue muscles and are important for hominid vocalizations. We have found a few hyoid bones matching those of modern humans, but most are more recent than 70,000 years.\n\nHowever, this can be hard to date much further back. A find of our possible-ancestor-but-maybe-cousin Homo heidelbergensis showed a more human-like hyoid. Other bones from Spain show human-like hyoids from nearly 530,000 years ago! While convergent evolution is possible, if the common ancestors of humans and Neanderthals shared this sort of trait, the ability to make human-like speech sounds may be much older. Neanderthal fossils from Kebara in Israel show a human-like hyoid that should have been capable of human-sounding speech.\n\nIn addition to hyoid bones, some research on the evolution of human vocalization has looked at the proportions of the vocal tract (the length of our mouth and pharynx). This shows that neanderthals as well as early humans should have been anatomically capable of speech.\n\nIn addition, we can model the hearing range of our ancestors. Skulls and ear bones are much more common than hyoid bones, and by comparison to the anatomy of modern humans and other primates, we can model the range of sounds their ears were meant to hear. Again, this points to a shift to being able to hear higher frequencies and consonants among the Homo genus, even before the emergence of modern humans.\n\nChomsky and others argue that human language appeared 70-100k years ago, while others argue for more recent evolution of 50k years ago. It is impossible to say for certain, but the fossil and genomic evidence indicates human-like speech and hearing was present quite early in hominid evolution, and by 70k years ago, there is no anatomical reason we couldn't have modern languages (this doesn't mean they definitely existed, though).\n\nNow let's move on to lifestyle! We have found early hominid burials with ornaments, and those of Neanderthals as well. Just last year, a grave of a human child that was buried was found in a Kenyan cave, dated to around 78,000 years ago. The child was wrapped, positioned, and buried shortly after death. In Israel, 15 individuals were found with ocher-stained tools in a 100k-year-old grave, and it is possible they were ritually buried.\n\nIt is likely more ritual was added over time- while the dead H. heidelbergensis in Spain may have simply been bone-caching, there is much more widespread evidence for burials and ritual after 120k years ago, with much more complete evidence and rituals as we move closer to 60kya. While Neanderthal burials are controversial to some, burial and ritual seem to be relatively widespread among humans during your timeframe. In the above examples, intentional burial is often inferred from the positioning of the bodies (in Israel, for example, the placing of a hand on top of a deer skull and antlers across the neck) or presence of burial artifacts.\n\nNext is nomadic lifestyles. This is harder still to guess at; alongside human bones, we find tools, animal bones showing evidence of fire and being butchered or cracked for marrow, and so on. However, from the lack of evidence regarding pastoralism, permanent dwellings, or agriculture, most of which would be necessary to a sedentary lifestyle, we can guess that most humans were more or less nomadic, in that they were usually on the move. This may not mean constant wandering; based on what we know of hunter-gatherer societies, they often moved with the herds, seasons, and other factors. We know that they hunted, and from their teeth and genetic adaptions, we know that they were hunter-gatherers who ate a broad variety of plants and animals. From the speed with which humans colonized the planet, it may be safe to assume humans quite readily explored and moved over long distances to new places. The timeline of human migration out of Africa, the number of waves, and so on is being adjusted, but by 70kya, our hypothetical modern human could have been living in a variety of different places or climates.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nA biologically modern human 70kya would have had a nomadic lifestyle, but it would likely have varied considerably depending on where they were, with relatively small local movements, seasonal migrations, or more long-distance movement. This is one of the hardest to pin down from fossil evidence. They would likely have been fully capable of human vocalizations, but we do not know how complex their vocal languages were. Burials and rituals existed.\n\nEdit: u/Perfect_Inflation_70 pointed out this paper discussing permanently settled communities of hunter-gathers that could have been quite large. In coastal areas with rich resources that were reliable, or other places with a year-round high density food supply, it is possible for groups to settle (or have very low mobility) without agriculture. Many tribes and groups contacted in the modern area have patterns like this, and it does make sense they existed the time period discussed; however, especially if they were coastal, it may be difficult to discover large middens filled with fish and shellfish given changes in the coastline. So it's a possibility, and an example of how new discoveries are constantly being made and timelines adjusted.\u201d"], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "/u/maxarc explains how social media algorithms are getting boys and young men trapped in the insecurity-to-fascism pipeline and what we can do about it.", "selftext": "", "id": "wylwqe", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/indepthaskreddit/comments/wy0o58/how_do_we_save_young_men_from_being_drawn_into/ilvtjt2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3", "created_utc": 1661552221.0, "score": 1196, "permalink": "/r/DepthHub/comments/wylwqe/umaxarc_explains_how_social_media_algorithms_are/", "comments": ["**tl;dr** I think social media in its current incarnation inevitably converges into a mathematically and sociologically perfect radicalization machine. I propose a way to maybe fix it, or at least start a discussion, at the bottom (below the second ------ separator).\n\n----------\n\nI've thought about this more than a little bit over time and have sort of convinced myself that social media in its current incarnation **inevitably** morphs into an ever more perfect radicalization machine as a result of how our financial incentives work. No matter how you modify the algorithm, it *must* and *will* become a radicalization engine simply due to how society currently has financial incentives for, and how it defines, \"*engagement.*\" However, this also makes it self-destructive with boom/bust cycles.\n\nSocial media has a heavy emphasis on free speech, and likes or up/downvotes exist to nominally give users a way to self-moderate extremist rhetoric and bad takes. In a perfect world, free speech is supposed to be like a free market of ideas, where when argued in good faith, the best ideas win. The problem is that ALL social media platforms undermine this by amplifying bullshit. Bullshit = more clicks/engagements = more promotion. This is inherently destructive to the \"marketplace of ideas\". *The ideas that win in this system are not the best ones, they're the most polarizing ones.*\n\nA laissez-faire content moderation philosophy claiming \"free speech\" while having an algorithm that promotes divisiveness and demagoguery is a poison pill that, on every social media platform yet invented, leads to the death of the platform for good ideas andproliferation of toxicity, ignorance, and hate. Reddit is somewhat resilient to this because rather than being a single platform, it's more like a million different platforms (subreddits), but you see the same cycle play out on individual subreddits again and again.\n\nBut even on Reddit, which has downvotes, because social media is an \"opt-in\" activity, toxicity causes more good faith users to eventually opt out. This leads to a downward spiral w/good users leaving. See /r/worldnews comments, which used to be insightful (perhaps hard to believe, but I've been on reddit [a long time](https://www.reddit.com/u/masamunecyrus) and it was once true) and are now mountains of ignorance, shitposts, propaganda, and bigotry.\n\n**There is no easy solution to this problem so long as algorithms exist to maximize engagement.** The algorithms may work when content is moderated (e.g., old fashioned newspapers), but without editorial gatekeeping, they only maximize that speech which maximizes rage, minimizing voices of reason. The \"engagement\" metric creates an almost mathematically and sociologically perfect radicalization machine.\n\n--------\n\nI don't know if a solution to this problem is even possible on a free website (if posting costed money or some sort of tokens, or if there were a subscription fee, things would probably be quite different), but I can at least offer up an idea for a solution. Ultimately, engagement is incentivised because social media companies need to make money to offer a free service, and advertisers pay per click. More views = more clicks, or so the conventional wisdom goes. What if, instead, we recalibrated our metrics for **user quality and satisfaction**?\n\nA happier, healthier social media environment would be less \"engaging\", yes, that is a fact. But perhaps those engagements would be higher quality. Instead of 10 million views, perhaps we'd have only 500,000 views. But if those 10 million views had only a 0.001% click through rate and the 500,000 views had a 0.1% click through rate as result of people being happier, those 500,000 views would be more valuable since they have 5x the total number of ad clicks. Furthermore, I suspect that a happier user is probably more inclined to spend more money once they've clicked through on an ad, and probably also be more likely to be a repeat customer.\n\nBasically, I'm proposing that instead of a race-to-the-bottom to maximize the number of ever lower quality views, could we have a system that promotes a race-to-the-top, maximizing the satisfaction of of users, leading to fewer but higher quality (i.e., more lucrative) views? Metrics that maximize these factors could almost certainly be designed based on the kind of data that Google/Facebook already collect. And in terms of a content moderation system, machine learning algorithms have already been invented that can estimate various subjective views of comments (e.g., content effort, toxicity, partisanship, anger, happiness, curiosity, etc.). Someone would have to make some decisions on how to weight comments to inspire a positive environment, but I think it's certainly something that is possible, and there are more than enough PhDs employed at some of these companies to start working on the problem.", "Hi!

Mostly comedy skit channels. Long story short I hate doing that now because god forbid I don't immediately scroll past a video that turns out to be some bigotry nonsense - it will immediately populate the feed with similar videos. Right now I don't even let videos with people I don't know play - if I see a person and it's not an established channel, I scroll past ASAP.

The \"problem\" (and this is focusing on the second to last paragraph) is that happy, healthier people is less likely to be searching for something to fill them, as they are more likely to already be satisfied with what they have. Someone that is unhappy will tend to look for ways to be happy. And thus be more vulnerable to the ad that shows the happy person enjoying the advertised item.\n\nIn short, it's probably what the \"algorithm\" converges to because it works. As hopeless as that sounds.", "While I do not subscribe to the belief that these systems turn into \"perfect\" radicalization machines, I share the overall spirit and tone of your case. It's a huge fuckin concern and our incentive structure coupled with a lack of legislative oversight has fomented the creation of these really horrific attention-engines. To add to your statement, I would submit similar forces are somehow at play for online communities that would otherwise appear to be resilient to those kinds of profit motives. Case in Point: Metafilter.\n\nMetafilter is often considered one of the web's most welcoming communities. it's been around a very long time. Signups are gated by a $5 fee. Most active participants have been with Metafilter for 5, 10, oftentimes 15 years or longer. When I first started visiting nearly 20 years ago it was a type of old school shared weblog with an always interesting mix of tech/culture/thought provoking stuff. These days the shared weblog character still exists but it now has a very, *very* strongly left leaning character. I would go so far as to say culturally militant in certain circumstances. Dissenting opinions are often shouted out in the classic metafilter way, which is to bombard the person with edge cases and semantics and seemingly avoid making a good-faith presumption unless you are backed into a corner.\n\nThat's not to say that extreme rhetoric is a major component of the site. It isn't. Nor is the average MeFite a nasty online persona and I neither support nor disavow the positions of such average MeFites. It's just a site after all, a collection of many different people. The extremes I am speaking of on Metafilter tend to only arise during a culturally or politically divisive issue (which do seem to have increased in frequency). I just wish to point out that the \"vibe\" of the site as a meeting place itself has very clearly morphed away from how it used to be into a more politically extreme end of the spectrum in spite of a clear lack of financial motive to promote such behavior. It's as if the participants self-selected their culture over time or something similar.\n\nI dunno, just some thoughts I wished to add. Wonderful comment you wrote, thanks very much for it", "> Basically, I'm proposing that instead of a race-to-the-bottom to maximize the number of ever lower quality views, could we have a system that promotes a race-to-the-top, maximizing the satisfaction of of users, leading to fewer but higher quality (i.e., more lucrative) views?\n\nWe absolutely could, and as you mention, the ML tools we have now are already good enough to support this. I wouldn't even be surprised if those systems are already designed and ready to go, and just need to be deployed.\n\nThe biggest problem I think is the meta-incentives on the companies themselves. There isn't enough pressure for companies to want to do this, and in fact implementing it will probably cost them a lot of money in lost revenue and end up with another company growing larger and taking its place. Maybe it could be shown that higher user satisfaction leads to more users sticking around and this problem will self resolve, but I think social media has successfully shown that you don't need to even like the platform to use it, and there's very effective ways of getting people hooked even when they're unhappy. So I think the pressure will need to come from an external source in order for this to happen.\n\nDesigning that external pressure and putting it into action is in my opinion much harder than designing a better social media algorithm (but that might be my bias since I'm more familiar with ML). Speaking of newspapers though, I'd say tabloids employed similar tactics (of pushing anything that drives engagement, regardless of quality) and the newspaper industry survived, so maybe the problem isn't insurmountable. The tools that tech companies can employ to grab and keep your attention are far more advanced than what tabloids had though, so it's hard to say.\n\nMaybe a solution, as strange as it sounds... is to start paying for social media?", "I think one of the bigger issues here is the flawed premise that capitalism is built on. The marketplace really only values one thing: money. It is not economically beneficial to promote things that are beneficial to society, like non-extriemest views that fail to generate clicks. The money isn't there, and I really can't see a good way for the free market to correct that problem. \n\nWe can skirt around the issue by proposing economic motivators to change their calculus: things like taxes or holding them economically accountable for things promoted on their sites. I think these things miss the mark entirely - they need a radical reorganization of their priorities. Until then, I don't think things will meaningfully improve.", "Unfortunately I don't see the current algorithms within the social media platforms that already exist (at least the big ones like FB, insta, tik tock) to be modified to fit the system that you describe that values quality/satisfaction > engagement maximizing.\n\nFinancial incentives are just too big for the current platforms. Without some heavy government intervention, these companies wouldn't exactly be motivated to change their ways.\n\nI do see independent and new platforms being created that run on the systems that you explained. Though, they may not get to the size of heavy weights like insta/tik tock. \n\nA program that specializes in maximum engagement will draw and keep a larger portion of the population. But I think independent platforms that can at least start pulling those away from that group who are at risk of being \"radicalized\" and into a platform where that isn't a potential issue would be a step in the right direction.", "I've actually spent a lot of time thinking about social media and sm algorithms as a whole. As far as I can tell, there's 3 \"types\" of social media: \n\nInstagram and tiktok, which are both the \"tabloid\" type, in the sense they mostly get engagement through fake, unbelievable, or too-good-to-be-true posts. For example, the most watched videos on tiktok are magic tricks by a very talented magician, and some of the most common videos on tiktok are either fake, or short video essays with barely any research put into them presented as an \"all encompassing\" philosophy. \n\nReddit and Twitter, which both act as the \"popularity contest\" of the internet. The most upvoted / liked posts on these sites don't contribute new ideas; they repeat the ideas and opinions everyone else has in simpler words. People on these sites vote based on how much they agree with a post, rather than by the quality of the post. \n\n4chan, which acts as the \"bulletin board\" of the internet. On 4chan, there are no upvotes, downvotes, no \"likes\", no real sorting of any kind. The posts at the top of the page get the most replies per second, while the posts at the bottom get the least. The easiest way to get your post seen is to post \"ragebait\", or something that will get users so upset they take time out of their day to leave a comment. As a result, this format somewhat strongly encourages discussion, by encouraging users to create divisive opinion posts instead of saying the same opinions as everyone else. \n\nI'd go as far to say that it's one of the more \"ideal\" social media setups, but the entire concept falls apart once you have too many people in one thread, as the thread will stay at the top of the page all day and receive comments faster than anyone could read them. Of course, it does have its reputation, but that seems to only keep out the faint of heart. \n\nI propose that an \"ideal\" social media site would encourage divisive posts to foster discussion and decrease the number of users wasting bandwidth with \"OMG this! So much this!!\"\n\nYou could probably have a similar subreddit setup, where users must be invited to contribute to a particular sub (but all posts are publicly visible).

I found it ambiguous in parts. I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering, and took Fluids II as an elective, where we covered supersonic flow in various situations, including cases like this one. \n\n  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the key detail that is left out is an explanation of the [nozzle shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Laval_nozzle), as it's what makes the difference. First, you need \"choked flow\", which is what you get through a hole with a high enough pressure differential and a small enough aperture. Fluid velocity through the hole in this condition is capped at Mach 1, the speed of sound in the fluid ( which depends on the fluid's temperature, humidity, things like that, it's not always 340 meters per second.)\n\nSecond, you need an appropriately shaped nozzle on the exhaust side of the choked flow, like a Laval nozzle (linked above). At this point, an interesting thing happens.\n\nWe're used to fluids getting faster when you constrain them, right? Normally, if you make a pipe narrower, the fluid speeds up, and if you make it wider, it slows down. However, when it's coming out of choked flow into a nozzle like this, it actually does the opposite. The nozzle gets wider, and the fluid speeds up. It's counterintuitive. Instead of velocity decreasing, the pressure and temperature decrease, and velocity increases. ([Example](https://qr.ae/pvMKq0)) The bigger the bell of the nozzle (relative to the neck, called expansion ratio), the greater the effect.\n\nFrom there, the original answer covers things pretty well. You get the best performance when the exhaust pressure is equal to the ambient pressure, which is why the nozzle is so big on a rocket's second stage, when it goes from little to no atmospheric pressure. If a motor produces something like shock diamonds, it's overexpanded, and if it expands a lot afterward, its underexpanded.  You can watch exhaust flow progress from overexpanded, to perfectly expanded, to underexpanded at any rocket launch. By the time a first stage cuts off, you'll see exhaust gasses expanding to many times the diameter of the vehicle upon exit. And when the second stage lights, it looks much better again.", "He's also one of the better mods of that sub", "You know you're talking about some heavy technical shit when they pull out the Navier Stokes equations.

This makes teens highly receptive to positive social cues and encourages them to engage in behaviours that make their peers like them. This is important because adolescence is an age characterised (in part) by increased contact with peers and decreased contact with family (which helps bridge the gap from total-dependence childhood and independent adulthood). \n  \nAlongside this, the frontal cortex is developing much more slowly. This part of the brain is responsible for executive control, emotion regulation and inhibition. I'm adolescents, this area develops less rapidly than the emotion centres, and the connections between the two are less strong. Ultimately this means that teens find it hard to regulate behaviour in certain contexts - they especially find it harder to avoid doing things that they anticipate will get a positive reaction from peers. \n  \nWhen we say the brain finishes developing at 25, we mean the frontal cortex catches up to the emotion centres. By early-mid 20s, people are generally much better at regulating behaviour even in contexts with positive emotional valence because the prefrontal cortex is developed and the connections between the PFC and the emotion centres are strong. \n  \nThis large scale neural development is the normal developmental trajectory of the brain.\n \nThe brain does still change throughout life: new connection are formed, some connections are pruned (cut away), some connections are made stronger. However, your aversge person is unlikely to experience large scale neural changes akin to those between childhood-adolescence-adulthood again. There are exceptions which tend to be a result of atypical experiences like strokes or intensive training (like how London black cab drivers have unusually large hippocampi due to their unusual spatial memory), but for the most part the brain has \"matured\".\n  \nIn much the same way, the human body clearly reaches a point where it has matured and isn't still going through rapid development, but people can still change their body through things like exercise or diet.

Keep half, give away half, put the money in treasuries and index funds and live off the interest.", "[deleted]", "These are fascinating tales.  I\u2019ve spent a lot of time ruminating on them over the years, as well as thinking about what life could be like if I suddenly found myself on the \u201clucky\u201d end of a lottery ticket.\n\nMost of us have considered what it would be like to be filthy rich.  There have been countless movies portraying it, and songs on the radio, especially in rap culture, continually bombard us with how great it is to be rich and how much it sucks to be you otherwise.  And, it\u2019s really quite normal to imagine that, once you start receiving money and converting it into goods and services, what it would be like to continue doing that but on a larger scale.  \n\nWhat most of us *don\u2019t* consider, though, is how a sudden windfall can completely upend our humble lives.  We imagine life without money problems - who doesn\u2019t?  But obtaining all of your wealth gradually over time vs. one sudden windfall is akin to rain falling from the sky on occasion vs. a huge 6\u201d sheet of it falling with a *THWACK*.  One of these sustains life, the other ends it. \n\nWhen a person earns money over time, they gradually learn how to manage it.  They build networks of trusted friends and colleagues.  Their peers and neighbors gradually increase their own net worth and earning potential.  In a sense, their world *gradually* and *slowly* grows with their earnings growth.  Mistakes are made, but they\u2019re small mistakes and usually easily corrected.  One grows, learns. Improves.  \n\nConversely, when a person suddenly receives a massive windfall, nothing has changed except their bank account balance.  For a time, theyre still in the same house, surrounded by the same neighbors and class of people, have the same friends, work at the same place.  This is the demarcation point of normalcy, and where most lottery winners begin to derail.  This is where the big mistakes begin. People quit their job - tell their boss and coworkers to shove it, cutting off a significant portion of their life as they know it in the process, leaving a trail of anger and envy in their wake.  They sell their house and buy a much bigger one, living amongst people with whom they have zero in common.  Their \u201cfriends\u201d from here on out have questionable motives - they were not made organically through shared interests.  They did not meet people through business networking.  They don\u2019t share any interests with their neighbors because the only thing they\u2019re currently interested in is spending money, and their neighbors with wealth have it through years of sound financial management - which, you guessed it, involves not frivolously spending all of their money. \n\nSo you\u2019re left with mostly \u201cfriends\u201d who have questionable motives.  No colleagues to speak of, and your former ones are envious.  You have nobody you can trust.  Your family suddenly takes an increased interest in you and your affairs.  Can\u2019t trust them either.  \n\nYou are now on a lonely island.  \n\nBut hey, you have all this cash, which is great, right?  Wrong.  No matter how much you receive in a windfall, it can always be spent - and quickly too, if you\u2019re not careful.  Did you just win 100 million after taxes?  Go on, buy that 4 million dollar house. I mean, you have 96 mil left, right?  But the costs don\u2019t stop with the purchase.  You have to pay taxes on that house, each year.  And utilities and maintenance upkeep.  Plus you need to furnish it.  Clean it.  And who in their right mind owns a 4 million dollar house and also a Honda Civic?  Not you my friend, you get yourself a 6 or 7 figure car.  Maybe a few.  And why not a nice boat?  Shit, live large get a plane. \n\nThe above things are all affordable at first. But they have ongoing costs.  And they also come with a certain kind of lavish lifestyle where extravagance is encouraged.  More spending.  \n\n\u201cOk,\u201d you say, \u201cbut I have a ton of cash, what\u2019s the issue?\u201d\n\nThe issue is, and this is the key factor setting you apart from your newly acquired \u201cpeers\u201d - you have no more of it coming in.  It WILL eventually dry up.  And without income, you will eventually find yourself broke again.  And the bigger you are, the harder you fall. To go from baller status to completely broke AND having no marketable skills to recover means you\u2019re in for a long road (or short, depending upon your choices) of hardship and depression.  \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s silly, I\u2019ll just invest and live off the interest!\u201d  No you won\u2019t.  You may invest, but you won\u2019t restrain your lifestyle to living only off the interest.  That new, big pile of cash in your money bin will call out to you every night like a siren in the sea,until you give in and crash your boat of life onto her rocks.   It\u2019s only a matter of time.  \n\nMy final thought on this pertains to overall happiness and fulfillment with life.  Most of us work for a living and we generally look to continually improve our career.  Earning more down the road is a motivator - becoming more successful *through our own accomplishments* is a significant factor that leads to satisfaction with life.  When we buy something that we *earned*, it means so much more than if someone simply gave it to us, which is what happens when we convert lottery money to goods and services.  \n\nEventually you\u2019ll find yourself less and less satisfied with your life as you keep chasing that dopamine hit from buying things.  You\u2019re no longer accomplishing anything.  You\u2019re just spending someone else\u2019s money that is suddenly yours.  \n\nAnd in the end, when you\u2019re surrounded by stuff, have no friends or family that you can trust, no co workers to commiserate with, your neighbors don\u2019t want to associate with you due to having zero in common\u2026. You\u2019ll be lucky if you make it out alive, without any new addictions, without being constantly bothered by friends, family, and strangers alike for a piece of your pie.   Envy will follow you everywhere you go.  Whereas you were once a background dot in the fabric of society, you\u2019re now a huge target   \ud83c\udfaf. \n\nWas it worth it?  Is all the stuff you bought truly making you happy?  How has the human disconnection left you, emotionally and physically?\n\nI could be wrong. I\u2019ve never won the lottery.

A Count is a continental title belonging to the Franks, and from them the French, the Burgundians, the Goths, and importantly the Germans. In the history of England the Saxons, Angles, and Jutes conquered post-Roman Britain in waves of colonization and settlement. They established a series of Saxon Kingdoms in England. Having inherited North European/Scandinavian from their settler ancestors the Saxons held Moots and Wittens where the most powerful, influential, and richest men would be voted by the Ealdorman of the realm to be King. \n\nEaldorman were the chief landholders and the ones relied upon the most to raise fyrds, hundreds, and armies. They were in effect the noblemen of the land under the royal authority of the Crown they'd created/voted upon. With the Norman conquest in the 11th century of England the Saxon title of Earl, the derivative of Ealdorman, was reserved for a few distinguished land holdings and largely replaced by the Frankish/Norman Barons and Dukes. \n\nThe Peerage of the United Kingdom is the result of 1500 years of invasion, settlement, and assimilation. It includes at its lowest ranks the untitled manorial Lords and Knights, then Barons and Marquesses, then Earls, then Dukes, then Princes, and then the Monarch at its pinnacle.  A March is a border land near a dangerous frontier (like Wales) that a Lord grants, along with considerable autonomy and privileges, to a Marcher (also known as a Marquis). In the UK's Peerage a Marquis, or an Earl, is often seen as the equivalent of a continental Count who is not an immediate sovereign (they owe fealty to someone else).\n\nThe wife of a Duke is a Duchess. The wife of a Marquis is a Marquess. The wife of a Baron is a Baroness.

This is an extremely weird rabbit hole that nobody really knows the true consequences of yet. Imagine getting paid to borrow money. Several countries have been experimenting with this over the last 7 years, and a few I believe for even longer). \n\nAKA...rates *can* go lower than zero, as they have been in several countries.\n\n>The chair of the FED (Jerome Powell) said a few months back that they have no intention of going to negative interest rates, so that means these past 40 years of propping up markets by reducing bond rates has probably come to an end.\n\nThe US just doesn't need to go below zero. But more importantly, the \"propping up of markets\" doesn't come from the *lowering* it comes from rates being low. They don't have to lower rates below zero to prop up asset prices, that has already been happening and will continue to happen for as long as rates are this low. \n\nAnd...QE. The Fed's solution for not going negative is quantitative easing, which also definitionally props up asset prices. QE involves printing money to buy stuff, so it can increase indefinitely. \n\n>one might also argue they are also currently incentivized to increase rates to combat rising inflation.\n\nThe Fed wants rates higher, they have been begging for fiscal stimulus to cause inflation so they can normalize rates. This is standard economics. \n\n>This is why there is fear. The FED has been sticking its hands in for 40 years to prop up markets, and now it seems they are going to stop, at least for now.\n\nThink about why the Fed would have to increase rates to reduce inflation (aka asset prices). It's because asset prices are being pushed up by something else (fiscal stimulus or supply chain disruptions or both depending on your political lens). So the \"propping up\" can stop because the thing being propped up is holding itself up. Why does this portend doom? This is a good thing.

You can't short sell it because nobody would be on the other side of the transaction, if you're gaining infinite money it means the other person is losing infinite money. \n\nThe reason central banks use negative interest rates is as a disincentive to save. Say a company has $1 million and an idea that could make them a 5% gain in a year. That 5% gain is nice but maybe not worth the risk something goes wrong, they would rather put the money in a savings account and make 1%. Now imagine the savings account has negative interest, their option is to make 5% or lose 2%, the difference is essentially a 7% gain, maybe that is worth investing in. \n\nOn the other side, it also makes banks more willing to lend, because when their deposits are losing value they need to overcome that loss by making money, and the way they make money is making more loans.", "> Why would anyone buy them?\n\nThis has already been answered, but I think the more satisfying answer is this: it costs money to store money. A statewide pension fund with billions of dollars can\u2019t just leave it all sitting in a checking account or stuffed under a mattress - they have to put it somewhere - but they still aren\u2019t interested in rolling the dice on corporate debt or the stock market.

It's like the bank essentially credits the researcher's account with $200,000..... But the key word being 'Credit' and not 'Transfer' - It's almost as if we assume the 200k is *Transferred* from the bank's accounts, but in actual fact the 200k is just added to the loan recipient's account without any actual *transfer* or similar deduction of funds from the banks accounts taking place?\n\nIs this on the right track!?

The US military needed the manpower, and the theory was that if we lower some entrance standards, no biggie, right?

There is a delicate balance the services have to strike between being selective in who they let in and meeting their recruitment needs. A modern military requires more intelligent service members - not every Joe Schmoe can troubleshoot the Avionics on an F-15, handle the logistics of a battalion, or even just be an IT person.\n\nBut this was back as late as the 60s, and these troops couldn't do basic math, remember their grandmother's name, would play practical jokes by tossing live grenades instead of inert ones, or forget their squad set up an ambush, leave, and walk right up to it and get shot.\n\nThey let in actually medically diagnosed mentally handicapped people.\n\nThey did far worse than their peers, they died at higher rates, and turns out they were outperformed by their civilian counterparts who never were enlisted in the first place.\n\nAnd then in the 80s the DoD just straight up botched the ASVAB grading (think the SAT to join the military) that let in more less than qualified applicants. So there was a second generation of lower intelligence enlistees the military had to deal with.\n\nSome links below:\n\n[Wiki: Project 100,000 aka McNamara's Folly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_100,000)\n\n[Book review/summary of McNamara's Folly: The Use of Low-IQ Troops in the Vietnam War by Geegory Hamilton](https://www.gwern.net/reviews/McNamara) (more IQ focused than I'd like, but probably the best summary out there)\n\n[Low-Aptitude Men In The Military: Who Profits, Who Pays?, Laurence and Ramberger\u00a01991](https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/ses/1991-laurence-lowaptitudemeninthemilitary.pdf)\u2060.)

Which, may I point out, you completely dropped topic on.  \n\n>Because they'd need to have the private key of the NFT representing the property in custody to make modifications to documents that they own and those modifications wouldn't have to go through some centralized agency that can gate keep access to the records.\n\nIt's like Star Trek technobabble, crypto-flavoured.  Just jam enough buzzwords in there and it *sounds* like sophisticated high-tech assurance ... but it's actually what you accused me of: an assertion with no justification.  \n\nFirst off \"they\" - the mortgage company?  The people you just signed a contract with, and presumably provided your private key to, so they could file a mortgage that you signed for?  Needing to have a password doesn't assure that what is done *after the password is entered* is valid or verified.  Homeowner needs to review the document before approving it?  I mean, that's already the case - you're supposed to read the contract before signing it.  Needing to have the key is either such a barrier mortgage holders don't want to deal with NFT mortgages, or a relatively trivial formality for a system subject to all the same pitfalls as the current one.  Needing to have a key doesn't verify the document is accurate to the deal, or that it's contents don't have a loophole or a typo or any number of other innocuous accuracy issues, nor does it protect either party from the potential malfeasance of the other beyond what the current system already does.  \n\nSecondly \"the private key of the NFT representing the property\" ... there's so much implementation, and so many pitfalls here, that you've simply handwaved past.  Who minted those keys, and how did each property owner end up with them?  Some charity?  The government?  Some lucky grifter, and every property owner had to buy the NFT to their own property?  How are those NFT's valid *on any legal basis*, and how would they be enforced regarding possession?  What about phishing and hacks - now instead of scamming grandma into transferring her chequing account, they can just talk her into giving them her whole house - signed away in an instant via private key.  Worse, tech-savvy crypto people lose their keys all the time, so normal people who barely understand the system ... what if they lose their key?  Property goes dead?   Can't be sold, can't be transferred, can't be borrowed against - no changes to it's database object can apply without they to approve.  Whoever \"they\" are mints a new one?  What's to stop that from happening and just replacing a valid and owned key?  What's to stop the minting party from leaving a few debts off of the new key?  \n\nThird, adoption.  Why would any of the players sign on?  What's in it for them?  Lenders have no reason to bother with an alternate filing system, they're fine with things the way they are, nor do they benefit by turning over their very ability to issue mortgages to an \"anonymous decentralized system.\"  Homeowners don't have the power to compel lenders to file their mortgage on the blockchain, even if they want it; while they get slightly better record keeping hypothetically but wind up with a digital token that represents home ownership they need to protect and administer, and aren't necessarily protected from any of the bad things in the mortgage market if those things happen to occur off the blockchain.  Lien holders can't be obliged to file their lien through blockchain, you can't assure me that all records would definitely exist there.  The people you think are gatekeeping records ... why would they sign on?  Or are they all signing on because some other authority told them to?  ...Why not just that other authority administer recordkeeping and arbitration and cut out the NFT middleman?  *Everyone* in that marketplace needs to adopt the system before the system starts having any of the benefits that are supposed to encourage adoption.\n\nFourth, you're making a big deal about mystery liens, but why would the company issuing some random-ass lien bother to file their lien on your NFT when you just got done saying the homeowner needed to provide their key to make changes to the NFT of \"their home\" - given that liens are typically the result of bad-faith borrowing or failure to pay ... why do you imagine any homeowner who is subject to a lien would provide consent for applying it to their property?  That has to be considered a bug and not a feature - because if you're backhanded wanting to decommission all lien-like systems of involuntary debt, that's a very separate, huge, point and not something we can just cruise past like it's obvious and totally a great idea.\n\nFifth ... who is verifying this particular blockchain?  Why do they care to do that?  ...Same reason as any other crypto, you say?  Is your enthusiasm for this idea ... because attaching the entire mortgage system to a specific blockchain would inflate value of any associated tokens \"to the moon\" as the crypto bros like to say?  The system adds nothing original that a governing authority wouldn't solve cheaper, easier, and more elegantly, and none of the parties supposedly using it seem to actually benefit ... but crypto people are getting paid for processing verification - while also inflating the value of the coins they're paid in?  Cause that seems like the real meat here: crypto just wants to take a middleman cut of the mortgage market.\n\n>Come on, if you know anything about blockchain you know that this would require a successful sybil attack.\n\n\"Assertions made with no justification can be dismissed with no justification.\" \n\nIf you know anything about blockchain, you'd know this was a spurious dismissal.  It's been 12 years since there was any universally-accepted single blockchain.  Parallel, offshoot, competitor, and fork, currencies have been the norm since 2010.  That you're assuming somehow digital tokens for physical property & credit is somehow going to end up with only a single system with *such* universal adoption that it would require a sybil attack just to fork is, frankly, laughable.  No other crypto project has managed that thus far, and you haven't even sold why anyone would sign on to this one.\n\nBut allow me to remind you that the system you proposed at the start of this comment wouldn't allow liens at all.  Homeowner is not going to consent to adding involuntary debt to their property, so they ain't handing over their key.  So, does the lien holder file their lien offline, same as now?  Or do they file on a different blockchain?  Can't file it on this one.  That mortgage holders can't change debt held by your property without the property owners' key is, purportedly, a selling point.", "> Daily transactions does not require the state to authenticate and authorize them. Where I live this is pretty costly. This can be done by any trusted entity, electronically, greatly reducing processing times and costs.\n\nI don't think I'm following. What do you mean by 'authenticate and authorize them' that can't be done by a centralized government server? For example, when I file my taxes online, or send some cash via SEPA, are those transactions being 'authenticated and authorized', in your terms?\n\n> Also, an append only DB won't be enough - by having the state manage the database you solved the \"we can trust the receiver\" but you are not solving the \"can we trust the sender?\" part.\n\n*Distributed* trust is hard, which is why it needs the efforts of a blockchain.\n\nCentralized trust is (comparatively) easy and very cheap, you use it every day when you login with OAuth2 and multi-factor authentication.\n\nAfter all, only the centralized receiver needs to verify the sender. For everyone else who is just reading the public ledger served by the centralized receiver, a Git-style cryptographic hash signature is as good as it's going to get in terms of trust and tamper-resistance.\n\n--\n\nUltimately, the issue with NFTs as deeds of property is that their blockchain *can't* be the source of truth in the real world, the way Bitcoin & Co. can be the source of truth in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin only represent Bitcoin, so having the bitcoins ( = knowing a certain cryptographic secret) automatically means *having* the bitcoins ( = being able to transfer the currency).\n\nBut NFTs claim to represent *off-blockchain* assets, with a value *other* than the simple ability to transfer them (i.e. not currency). But the only way to translate 'having [an NFT of] a Ferrari' ( = knowing a certain cryptographic secret) into 'having a Ferrari' ( = being able to drive it) is to persuade some nice gentlemen in Maranello to hand you the keys and let you take the car off the premise. And that's an inherently *centralized* activity - they will give you the car if and only if they're personally persuaded they should give you the car, they don't need to have 51% of the global Ethereum network agreeing with them.", "Stamp duty is paid for property transactions, not taking out mortgages.", "And another big chunk is the cost of consumer benefits like cash back and points.\n\nMy MasterCard travel points are worth hundreds of dollars every year.

I don't agree with this.  Most people want to be good, they are tempted by various things, rationalize why they should do the bad thing to get what they want, then finally do it. It is a realistic portrayal of human nature regardless of the systems involved.\n\nExcept OP doesn't *actually* say this. What he says is that LoTR operates more through the traditional lens of temptation (i.e sin/virtue dynamic) than demonstrating how evil and bad actions are emergent behavior through systemic evolution; which is absolutely true.\n\nIn fact, you more or less underline that opinion in your objection; sin isn't willfully doing evil (according to Catholic teachings), it's giving into or rationalizing a temptation, even if the rationalization is \"good\". For instance, stealing from stores to feed your family is still \"sinful\" in the Catholic mindset. Even though you are doing it for \"good reasons\", you are still doing \"bad things\" to get what you want. (This is the bulk of *The Confessions of St. Augustine*, btw).\n\nThere's more than just the ring itself that operates in LoTR in this fashion; you could sum up a lot of the conflict in the book, and in Tolkien's work as a whole, as \"people doing bad things for good reasons.\"\n\nAs an aside, Tolkien was 100% a devout Catholic; people often forget that he *converted C.S. Lewis from atheism to Christianity.* Without Tolkien, there's no Screwtape Letters; there's no Narnia. It's hard to not look at LoTR through that lens because it's entirely accurate in many ways.\n\nThat said, I agree with you that LoTR is not as fantastic or romantic as one might think. There's a good reason why it's often the flag-bearer or standard-issue reference for low fantasy.

Also you can do the exact same thing to any male NPC you encounter. You can agree or disagree with her breakdown of Sexism in Video Games but it did felt like bad takes from an \"outsider\" to GamerGate.\n\nNow lets look at Zoe Quinn. First off I can't believe the OP just hand waved positive press of her game because it was free. Just because she didn't gain financially from it doesn't mean she didn't personally profit from the exposure.

This has been *exhaustively* documented since GG, and even Gjoni has expressly recanted the implication that sexual favours or relationship were traded for good reviews of her game. \n\nThis underlying story, the inciting incident of the whole movement ... is complete and total fiction, fuelled by one bloke's salty blogpost where he complained bitterly about his ex and how he got broke up with.  \n\n>The reason everyone had such a visceral reaction to it back in 2014 wasn't because of Zoe Quinn receiving favorable reviews, but the total lash back at anyone criticizing this.\n\nSo, keeping that in mind, when she's effectively just being criticized \"for recieving good reviews\" and people are accusing her of shagging her way to the top and sending her gendered attacks and threats - entirely based on fiction - then other people clapping back at that isn't really something to read into.  When there's an entire movement dedicated to \"this lady can't *possibly* get good reviews honestly\" and then attacking her, review sites, and anyone who stuck up for either party - there was a certain fervor to defending the lie at the core of that, and the rest of the gaming community wasn't remiss to mention that.  \n\n>People who weren't there don't remember, but all of mainstream media went after gamers. \n\nIn what context?  Because I think that this is rather a massive exaggeration, at best.  Outside of the normal old-person pearl-clutching nonsense about how vidya games are killing the youth and destroying society, they were mostly treating gaming as a rising scene and industry, most mainstream coverage of gaming - that wasn't in the context of gamergate - was trending positive compared to the decade preceding.  Mainstream coverage of Gamergate was not \"going after\" gamers at large, despite sometimes struggling to distinguish between Gamergate and gamers.  Mainstream media reported on Gamergate, and certainly not glowingly, but I don't think that it's an attack on gamers to call out that GG as a movement was targeting women in gaming, effectively in general, and outspoken and/or feminist women in gaming in particular.  We weren't under attack or being gone after.\n\n>It even happened on reddit, where literally half of gaming subreddits had [Deleted] posts and comments.\n\nThis is the other kind of wild logic that Gamergate was criticized for.  \"Some posts were removed on reddit\" therefore \"media conspiracy.\"  But there's never been any meaningful advice, posts and comments are removed all over reddit all the time, and GG was already in the habit of taking literally anything and making a conspiracy against them out of it.  The subs that I was party to were removing GG content because Gamergate mistakenly assumed they were speaking for all gamers and their takes and their stories \"should\" be of interest to gamers as a whole - ie: GG was spamming their shit trying to push their agenda, while accusing everyone else of the same, and then routinely breaking site rules regarding harassment, threats, and coordinated attacks in the comments.  \n\nBut Gamergaters just decided that The Man was oppressing them, that anyone who disagreed with them was just an SJW or a nasty man-hating feminist, and that there was some big conspiracy afoot - and then were angry and aggressive about how persecuted they felt in the comments.  That's why they found themselves persona non grata in so many gaming circles so fast - because if we weren't going to be misogynist assholes with them, we were their enemy and deserved whatever treatment they could arrange for us.  \n\n>When the Zoe affair was fresh, literally noone cared. The moment it got supressed was when it exploded.\n\nI mean, the issue there was and still is that Gamergate was based on a lie.  A lie that Gamergaters insisted - and still do - was truth, and that any attempt from industry people or media to correct that lie was 'evidence' of conspiracy.

But OK.  \n\nI was unable to find any source that did not attest to the \"one mention on Kotaku\" specifically, some simply stating that, others stating that they checked.  The Kotaku part is important, because the ongoing allegation to start with was that Quinn shagged her way to positive coverage *on Kotaku* by hooking up with Grayson to get him to puff her game.  So you've uncovered not one but *two* mentions of Quinn by Grayson on the alleged site, that no non-GG source doing chronology of this has been aware of, after all this time?  Seems like the kind of things you'd drop links to.  Given that the only mention that has been confirmed - [this article](https://kotaku.com/the-indie-game-reality-tv-show-that-went-to-hell-1555599284) - occurred in March, I don't think it's unreasonable to wonder if you're confusing that \"only\" for \"third\" somehow - hook me up with the other two?\n\n>They were more than just professional acquaintances [...]\n\nThey were publicly friends preceding their relationship, and did you miss the part where they had publicly stated they were dating?  I didn't.  But *time* matters - stating their relationship existed is somewhat sidestepping the question.  By all accounts, except gamergate, they were only in a relationship after Quinn's breakup and after Kotaku or others had covered her game; if you're concerned about them being friends that's a weird hill to post up on considering how many journalists are friends with developers in the field they overlap on.  The reason GG gets criticism for being a sexist movement is the decision to tunnel-vision on Quinn or Sarkeesian, when they were hardly the only people to do the things we know actually happened, and yet no one else draws nearly the same laser-focus or meticulous deconstruction of their personal life in search of 'proof'.     \n\n>[...] he wrote articles focusing mostly on Zoe's game. One of the articles headline's was \"Admission Quest\"...oddly similiar to \"Depression Quest\".\n\nAccording to pretty much everyone except gamergaters - this is not just inaccurate, but an outright lie.  [Admission Quest](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/admission-quest-valve-greenlights-50-more-games) wasn't published to Kotaku, but to RPS, - note that this is at best a case of moving the goalposts - and wasn't \"focused on\" her game, even mainly: it was a highlight of that month's Steam Greenlight additions, that Quinn's game was a part of, and Grayson had focused on the three top-reviewed games from that list, of which Quinn's game was one.  This was exactly how he covered Steam Greenlight releases up until the program wrapped, just prior to his departure from RPS.  \n\nA writer who normally covers Steam Greenlit, and who normally highlights highly-reviewed or notable games from the list of approved games in that coverage, did exactly that - including a game whose dev he was friends with, whose game undeniably had the positive press and notable controversy around it to merit it's mention alongside \"Tangiers\" and \"Treasure Adventure World\" both of which were less notable (Tangiers is still struggling to release, and TAW took another two years to full release).\n\nWhen you look at it trying to prove a conclusion, you can totally fabricate a nefarious conspiracy.  But if we compare that even to the allegations - it doesn't live up to expectations.  The article mentions her game almost in passing, borrows a screenshot from the one functional game in the 'notable' three, and the whole thing mostly is filler text and then a list.  Hardly the feature billing or glowing review you're dressing it up as.  If you look at it in context, from a step back - this isn't the sinister shit you're making it out be.  The absolute tunnel-vision on Quinn is inexplicable, *if this is your issue,* because this is the case with almost all gaming journalism.  Journalists know devs, they're in overlapping industries, and they at times need to cover their friends' games.  \n\nThe fact that Gamergate only brings up those other cases in response to criticism about their choice of targeting Quinn is quite telling.  \n\n>This wasn't a bunch of angry nerds typing up angry posts because gasp a woman decided to make a video game, as is being presented. \n\nI mean, that's a very trite mischaracterization of what the movement is criticized for, so sure, obviously not.  It was a bunch of angry nerds typing angry essays and sending harassment, death threats, and attacks, because women decided to intrude on their space in ways they disapproved of.  Those people were already mad that Quinn was getting good reviews for her game, they were already mad that 'feminists' said mean things about their games - Gamergate provided them with justification, with tenuous \"proof\" that what they wanted to believe was in fact true.\n\n>Gaming was extremely mainstream even back then.

One such spectacle was alleged harassment of women in video games and lack of female leads, which the previously mentioned clique milked dry. \n\nThis is so hilariously disingenuous. Gamergate was criticized as a sexist movement from the very beginning, because of who it chose to target and how selective it was in interpreting evidence or considering targets - something a woman did \"just happened\" to be the worst thing to ever happen to gaming, and a man doing the same shit gets completely forgotten and ignored.  Sure, no one was hanging around criticizing women as a whole, but that was never an allegation - it's just a shield to hide behind.  That this take goes on to pretend the harassment never occurred, and then even so far as trying to accuse them of \"the real\" harassment and - like no, dude.  Gamergate harassed the shit out of those people, and more; lying about that is a huge part of why GG gets the pushback it does.  The movement has never been accountable, much less proactive in addressing, it's membership's most problematic behaviors.  \n\nYou're fundamentally missing a point here though - criticism of Gamergate, like I've noted above, isn't predicated on their targets being lily-white and blameless.  It's predicated on how many thousands of other people in gaming meet the same standards and are subject to the same criticisms - and yet Gamergate has been tunnel-vision exclusively on the ones that are female, \"SJW\", and/or visible minorities.  \n\n> Oddly enough, Kotaku was owned by Gawker...you know...the one that went bankrupt after being ordered to pay 140 million in damages because they did not take down a video of Hulk Hogan's sextape. So the same company that vicariously defended Zoe and her band of delinquent misfits, creating one of the bigger PR debacles in recent history, also went down in flames because they wouldn't take down a sextape with a woman. Even after a judge ordered them to. This is the type of people you are defending.\n\nIs challenging someone like you to be honest \"defending\"?  I wasn't aware that it took so little.  \n\nBut even so - this ain't team sports.  I'm not sure what convoluted logic has you believing that Gawker's shit is relevant here, but I'm not taking that bait.  I don't give a fuck about any of those people as individuals, and I'm not \"defending\" any of them.  I'm criticizing Gamergate for attacking them, I'm pointing out that Gamergate choosing to focus on those people specifically is what they're criticized for, and lastly I'm noting that some of the things you're accusing them of are either misrepresented or outright false.  A movement that pretends to care about \"journalistic ethics\" should have a whole lot more care for truth and accuracy in their own messaging than that.  \n\n>>This is the other kind of wild logic that Gamergate was criticized for. \"Some posts were removed on reddit\" therefore \"media conspiracy.\"\n\n>It wasn't some posts.

The argument is clearly about whether it is more expensive, generally, to eat a meat-inclusive diet vs. a vegan one. Externalized costs are, by definition, not paid by those making the choice. Maybe OP is simultaneously wishing they weren't externalities and that the relative costs would go up so poor people would stop eating meat or at least so much of it. \n\nI speculate, perhaps unfairly, that this wasn't explicitly raised as a point because it looks unsavory to talk about the plight of the poor while also hoping to use the pain of expense to force them to do what you're currently trying to convince them to do. Nobody wins hearts and minds with \"or else\". \n\nThe real error, though, is the cost of time. Yes yes, it is very cheap to buy rice and beans. But holy shit are they a pain in the ass. When it comes to vegan eating, there are 3 variables: low cost, tastes good, easy to prepare. Choose 2, because the number of things that satisfy all 3 is a short list that gets old fast. \n\nFurthermore, there is the issue of \"quick bites\". It's a PITA when there's a Wendy's around the corner  or your friends say they are going by Popeye's. \n\nBeing vegan is simply a giant pain in the ass.

When we (as in North Americans) think of veganism, we don't think of rice and beans and lentils we soak overnight and leave in slow cookers while we go to work. We don't think of Indian-style vegetarian meals. We think of people like Gwyneth Paltrow carrying their non-dairy lattes to yoga class before heading out to a trendy restaurant for a salad made with pesticide-free, organic veggies grown in a greenhouse 20 miles away covered in a vinaigrette made daily by the head chef with herbs grown in his own garden.", "One could argue that a meat based diet is becoming a privilege in some Western countries. Where I live, fish is prohibitively more expensive than meat, where meat has become more and more expensive over the years as well, to the point only junk meat is affordable. Fish used to be food for the poor here. It now is a luxury.\n\nWe at home eat meatless five out of seven days of the week, precisely of this steep increase in meat/fish prices. I only eat salmon because Lidl (a German supermarkt chain) discount it as a marketing tactic to lure in people into their supermarkets. Normally salmon cost up to 50/75 euro/kg today. Other supermarkt brands respond to reducing the weight of the fish it sells, while keeping the price the same. But I refuse to pay 5/6 euro for a few slices of salmon. The same goes for meat. One trip to the butcher and it easily costs 30 to 40 euro's for a couple of meals.\n\nThe upbeat is that we have become chefs by mastering recipes using cheap parts of the animal. We don't do vegan only, because it's also expensive in our experience, regardless what OP has found. And like others have said, it is a pain in the ass to make vegan dinners. While dating, vegan was a real downer to be honest. Glad my partner is not a vegan.\n\nEggs, cheese, stock, onion, carrots, celery, tomatoes, paprika, mushrooms and herbs are our staples. Pork meat for meat flavored dishes and sometimes deli meats for lunch.", "\"I've never understood the argument that veganism is some form of privilege.\"\n\nThat's because it generally doesn't make sense. Half the world can only afford meat as a luxury and depends on vegetables as their staple, because it's cheaper and more available.\n\nBut, when you even suggest that the typical Western eater might possibly stop shoving the fatty numnums in their mouths they start pulling all kinds of nonsense out of their buttcracks, doing any number of logical backflips trying to come up with an argument where \"you're totally in the wrong actually.\" Calling people \"privileged\" is a post-2000 classic shame-fu move.  It's meant to deflect criticism and put the adversary on the back foot, it doesn't have much of a purpose unless you're talking about things like wealth and family money.\n\nThat said, there's a huge difference between an actual plant-based diet and eating vegan. Veganism is a religion, basically. Somebody in Nairobi eating 90% veggies for dinner isn't bothered by a few pats of butter or a splash of something animal-based in the dish, while proper \"vegan\" food means no meat byproducts of any kind in the food, at all, ever. Preferably the pan it was cooked in has never been soiled by filthy, filthy meat. They tend to pay hostage prices for their food, or spend tons of time and effort scanning ingredients at the grocery store.\n\nIf you've never dug into what it really means to be vegan, then you've probably never heard of bone char, even though you've probably consumed it. It's a meat industry byproduct that makes its way into just about everything. You've probably heard about pork processors using, \"everything but the squeal\", though. Traditional Jell-O isn't vegan at all, the gelatin base is beef-based. Tons of things - especially modern processed foods - don't seem to be meat while being very much meat.\n\nThis means that vegans tend to rely on certain stores, and certain brands, for all their staples, buying \"vegan\" versions of things like boxed mac n cheese that become their only option for that thing, making it very difficult for market forces to work their magic on prices.\n\nNon-vegan grocery item: $2\n\nSame item but the box says \"certified vegan\" or something: $7\n\nThere's no wiggle room in proper veganism for eating mostly vegetables but not stressing a bit of bacon fat in the dish. It's the secular world's answer to things like Orthodox Jewish and Muslim food rules, where any slight deviation from the scripture means that ye have sinned, and have broken Vegan Edge. It doesn't just apply to your food, either, it's about your shoes, your clothes, your everything you consume, and it tends to make all things in your life more expensive, and considerably so. The vegan often spends more for an inferior item, and it means not being able to do things like buy the cheap, decent shoes, because they have leather uppers. It makes the whole lifestyle more expensive and stressful, on average. It means that only a certain type of young, middle-class, and single person can really pull it off consistently. OR, a certain kind of wealthy couple who can take the multitude of steps it requires to basically remove their whole family from the normal consumption cycle and raise children who manage to get into their 20s without ever tasting a marshmallow.\n\nBasically, it's not the answer. Veganism doesn't mean \"you should eat mostly vegetables\", it means \"never shall ye consume the flesh or the substance of anything with a face, through any means\", and instead of accepting that this, itself, is unacceptable to most of the globe and never will be, they just get angry at other people. Very religious. Vegans are prone to the same sort of piety spiraling that you see in other religions, the kind that end in certain shocking festivals where actual people have themselves actually nailed to actual crosses and paraded through the streets in order to be the most like Christ. People sense this, and it's why they don't want veganism in their lives.\n\nLike most monkeys, though, vegans love to feel smart when they haven't earned it, so they tend to brush all this aside. On the surface the lifestyle seems doable enough, until you're in a grocery store scanning the labels on box after box, crying out, \"I can't eat ANY of this!\"\n\nHaving said *all that*, we come back to the average eater, who, again, starts getting wildly defensive at even the hint that they shouldn't be shoving fistfuls of barely-cooked animal flesh into their yap-holes non-stop while the crowd cheers. They also start talking all manner of weird nonsense, like the ever popular \"nutritional deficiencies\", trying to justify a world of no restrictions at all.\n\nOf course, it's very easy to avoid nutritional deficiencies with plants, else your ancestors would have all died. If you think meat is expensive now, picture fighting somebody else for their life about it, every time you want to eat. We aren't obligate carnivores. The vegan rule of thumb is \"any bean, plus any grain\", and you're good. Traditional rice and beans will keep you alive and healthy indefinitely.\n\n\"Meat lover\" is a weird religion all its own, wrapped up with all manner of goofy, irrelevant ideas like masculinity, nationalism, and on and on. The stance is full of excuses and tends to demonize the shit out of eating any vegetables, and deify things like stuffing your mouth with bacon and acting like it's God's perfect food when bacon is more useful as a flavorant in cooking than as a main dish. They think a lot of it is their idea when it's more likely that they're repeating ad propaganda from the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, somehow.\n\nFor a lot of them, meat eating offers a way to feel superior without doing any actual effortful thing to achieve superiority. It only asks them to stuff fatty numnums in the face. So it's very tempting and they get super defensive about including more veggies in the diet at all, because their culture A) prioritizes meat consumption for commercial ends and thus B) has raised generations of people who have no idea how to cook up a vegetable-centered feast so that it's something more satisfying than poorly-steamed plain broccoli on a plate, or an iceberg lettuce salad.\n\nOne of their favorite nonsenses in the last few years has been pushing the idea that cooking itself is somehow this Herculean task, as if every time you step in the kitchen you must basically cook Thanksgiving dinner. If you let them they transition into a screed about how all of cooking was done with unpaid labor by women, and on and on, which is their way of changing the subject and ignoring that the cooking world is packed with dishes that can be whipped up in 15 minutes or less with little more than a frying pan. You only need to learn maybe a half-dozen recipes that you're happy with, and then you're good.\n\nYes, of course it's cheaper to cook your food. Are you paying labor? I didn't think so. If cooking it yourself wasn't consistently cheaper than paying for the finished food, then the entire restaurant business would have no margin to speak of and would collapse. No, nobody is telling you to get your own tandoor, just learn how easy it is to make a grilled cheese, jesus fuck. The whole discussion is forever full of dishonest, evasive arguments. No, I don't care about the rotisserie chicken at the store, that's one thing, we're talking about the whole store.\n\nAgain, there's often no room in the middle for normal, actual people who are just trying to eat dinner and have satisfaction without spending too much time or money about it. It'e either \"meat is murder\" or \"RARRR I\"M A CARNIVORR\". It's \"cooking yourself is always cheaper than buying pre-cooked, in every circumstance\" vs \"OMG I have 58 kids to feed, and it's impossible for me to cook simple meals at home with my busy schedule! Are you some sort of misogynist! Do you think a woman's place is in the KITCHEN!\" It is a worthless discussion leaving most people with no new useful information to take home and feed themselves with. The whole discussion is just a handball for assholes to bat around online. \n\nThe truth is that meat consumption releases preposterous amounts of CO2, it's generally a very inefficient use of land, and for the end consumer the meat is getting more and more and more expensive with every passing day.\n\nIt's also true that meat consumption is kind of a dick move. It perpetually begs the question, \"If it's fine for millions upon millions of animals to be born into slaughter and bondage so you can stuff them in your face, then what the fuck makes your human life so valuable, if their lives are so perpetually cheap and disposable? What's the actual difference? They're a mammal, you're a mammal, why aren't YOU disposable?\" No matter how you answer that, meat-eating keeps asking it, again, and again. \n\nIt's also worth pointing out that every real scientific opinion on necessary human meat consumption per day is an amount of meat about the size of a pack of poker cards. \n\nMeanwhile, again, and setting morality aside, that's why most of the world has never relied on meat as the center of every dish, so there's tons of options out there. Less meat is the obvious way, but the discussion never seems to have a middle ground where people can reasonably exist.\n\nIt's an exhausting, pointless conversation in general, and never really goes anywhere useful.", "Comparing supermarket vegetables to Macdonald patties.\n\nI eat meat regularly and Ive eaten in macdonalds like 10 times in my life. \n\nMacdonald sells you a 2 euro drink that costs them fractions of a cent to produce.\n\nCompletely backwards argument.\n\nYes meat isn't cheap but 1 kg of chicken feeds you much more than 1kg of lettuce", "\"Taking these factors into account, diets containing animal products are almost certainly more expensive than plant-based diets\"\n\nThe factors being taken into account are the environmental effects, not true monetary value.\n\nIn other words it should be cheaper to eat vegan.

When you\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck you don\u2019t give a damn about externalized costs, you care about what the register is going to ring up and if you have enough to cover it. Privilege is not worrying about this and instead calculating externalized cost as a factor of environmental impact.\n\nThe reality is when you factor things that immediately impact someone and their eating experience, omnivore diets offer much more value.

Add the curry paste. Bake for one to two minutes. Add the grounded spices. You probably want to add some extra oil. Bake for another two minutes. Add pumpkin and stir the pumpkin to coat it in the paste and spices. Pour in the stock and coconut milk. Add tea egg with lemongrass. Bring everything to a simmer. If it is watery, add tomato paste. It also takes away the slight bitterness of the spices. When you see bubbles rising to the surface, add the rinsed chickpeas. Cover with lid. Then cook for about 15 to 20 mins or when the pumpkin and chickpeas are tender. \n\n**Serving** (where it gets godly good):\n\nSqueeze the juice of one lime into the curry, mix well, then cut the other lime into wedges to serve alongside. Just before serving, tear over coriander or mint leaves and serve in a separate bowl. Cut the naan breads into strips for easy dipping into the curry, serve yogurt in a separate bowl. Add coriander, yogurt, lime and dip naan in the bowl for the magic to happen.\n\n**Tips**\n\nThe coriander, greek yoghurt and lime really enhance the flavor of the dish. Go easy on the cumin seeds, as it easily overpowers the rest of the flavors. Serve in a bowl and eat with a spoon, if that makes sense. I use a large, 10 liter stainless steel pan/pot with lid for baking/ cooking.
