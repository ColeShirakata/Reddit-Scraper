We are taught to recognize the signs.\n\nAfter the rebellion fell, I knew they'd be coming for us. I had heard the stories. I knew how they operated. They would take a family member from each of our homes and replace them - placing an agent of their own choosing in the household of every one of us, leaders of the rebellion.\n\nFor a month, I waited. For a month, I watched my girls with doubt gnawing within me. Every morning when I woke them up, I looked at their faces and wondered if a stranger was looking back at me from out of my own daughter's eyes. Every evening when I fell asleep, I looked at my husband's head resting on the pillow beside mine, and wondered if the enemy was sleeping by my side, waiting for me to fall asleep so that he could snap his eyes open and watch me. Watch and report. Keep the rebellious troublemakers in check.\n\nThe constant tension grated on me. I was spread so thin as it were, trying to find shelter for our forces, safe houses where they might lie low for a time. I spent the days gathering intelligence on fallen agents, those of my people who had been captured by the enemy. My head throbbed almost constantly with worry. What did the enemy do with them, with the agents they had captured? Which of our secrets were safe? What knowledge had been tortured out of my men? Was the location of the base to which I had sent seventy families compromised? Had my people gotten there safely, or caught and butchered on their way there? The anxiety headaches grew worse with each day, and I could not help but wonder, as my husband handed me another mug of steaming coffee, if he was even the man I had spent the past fourteen years with.\n\nBut, despite my suspicions - despite watching carefully and looking for a slip up, waiting for the agent who had slithered into my home to make a mistake and reveal their identity - I couldn't find anything out of the ordinary. My girls were their usual selves. My husband just as he ever was. No one, I dared to believe, could have known my family well enough to imitate them without me noticing.\n\nFor a day or two, I dared to entertain the notion that they had not been taken. That no one had been replaced. I thought that, perhaps, my seniority in the rebellion had gone unnoticed. I had never been a public figure. My job was to sit in the back and make desicions. I planned raids and managed supply chains and communication apparatuses. Maybe, I whispered to myself, they had thought me unimportant. Maybe they had left us alone. Maybe my family, my girls, were safe.\n\nIt was a nice thought.\n\nOn the next day I finally realized my mistake. I had been so focused on my family, on trying to spot any inconsistencies with their behavior, that I paid so very little attention to anything else. Oh, how foolish I feel now, knowing I had missed it for more than a month. The fuzziness of my vision, the dream like quality of the passing days. That quiet humming at the edge of my mind, always there but not quite real. And, of course, the headaches. \n\nThere are signs, if they take you. We are taught to recognize the signs. The flawed vision, the tiredness, and the headaches. Always notice the headaches. The marks of a captured mind, struggling to wake up from a forced dream. A mind thrashing against its chains as it drowns deeper and deeper into a false reality.\n\nI had been such a fool. I had given them so much. Secrets, locations, names... I gave them all of our most crucial knowledge while my mind lay bare before them.\n\nSomewhere, far from wherever they were holding my sleeping body, an agent had slithered into my home. An agent that looks nothing like either of my girls. An agent that looks nothing like my husband.\n\nAn agent that looks like me.", "id": "x6jsks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Microfiction/comments/x6jsks/we_are_taught_to_recognize_the_signs/", "created_utc": 1662393782.0, "score": 1, "permalink": "/r/Microfiction/comments/x6jsks/we_are_taught_to_recognize_the_signs/", "comments": [], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "Paradise Regained.", "selftext": "\"I'm the only angel alive.
