I know it sounds bonkers, but bare with me, it's supposed to be bonkers.\n\n\nEach episode contains three skits each dealing with a separate topic of humanity without actual knowledge of the topic. Inbetween skits the Black Hole just talks to us while on a stage about their day-to-day life as everything in the universe, while struggling to figure our who they are as an individual. Its just pretty chill, also low-key thought-provoking and very moving.\n\n\nThe skits each cover separate topics of humanity and what it was like. It'll follow a group of characters each played by the Black Hole just with different clothes and wigs on, as they take part in the topic of the sketch while talking about it. Some times the show has \"guest stars\" on it that is just the Black Hole poorly imitating the stars voices. \n\nThe location the skits take place in changes every skit, sometimes it's a dentist office, movie theater, the top of a building, etc. Although each of them seem very off, in a weird way. Like little details are wrong, shadows aren't where they're supposed to be and other stuff that makes it seem eerie but not too much that it's a problem. It's kinda like the Black Hole painting a background that only uses the spoken information about it as a reference. \n\nThe comedy in the show is very dry humor as the Black Hole doesn't really understand exactly what the topic is and what comedy is in general. I really adore Nathan Fielder's comedy style, so just imagine that but more trippy.\n\n\nTldr: it's Joe Pera Talks With You, Key & Peele and The Midnight Gospel merged together if it was about an existential and accidental dry humor expert Black Hole."], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "What's your biggest fear and if you overcome it, then how do you conqueror it ?", "selftext": "", "id": "145vw5k", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/145vw5k/whats_your_biggest_fear_and_if_you_overcome_it/", "created_utc": 1686390016.0, "score": 1, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/145vw5k/whats_your_biggest_fear_and_if_you_overcome_it/", "comments": [], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "People that actually drink and eat things in Hotel Fridges, What do you do for a living?", "selftext": "", "id": "145vw1t", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/145vw1t/people_that_actually_drink_and_eat_things_in/", "created_utc": 1686390009.0, "score": 1, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/145vw1t/people_that_actually_drink_and_eat_things_in/", "comments": [], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "What's it like working as a coxswain?", "selftext": "", "id": "145w2m1", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/145w2m1/whats_it_like_working_as_a_coxswain/", "created_utc": 1686390637.0, "score": 1, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/145w2m1/whats_it_like_working_as_a_coxswain/", "comments": [], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "What's your dream job and why?", "selftext": "", "id": "145w2l6", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/145w2l6/whats_your_dream_job_and_why/", "created_utc": 1686390636.0, "score": 1, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/145w2l6/whats_your_dream_job_and_why/", "comments": ["Tv showrunner, creating anime though since I\u2019m American I can\u2019t create typical anime even so I enjoy creating stories and wish to spread them"], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "What's the most illegal thing you've done?", "selftext": "", "id": "145w2g6", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/145w2g6/whats_the_most_illegal_thing_youve_done/", "created_utc": 1686390622.0, "score": 1, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/145w2g6/whats_the_most_illegal_thing_youve_done/", "comments": [" Nice try, FBI.

I know it sounds bonkers, but bare with me, it's supposed to be bonkers.\n\n\nEach episode contains three skits each dealing with a separate topic of humanity without actual knowledge of the topic. Inbetween skits the Black Hole just talks to us while on a stage about their day-to-day life as everything in the universe, while struggling to figure our who they are as an individual. Its just pretty chill, also low-key thought-provoking and very moving.\n\n\nThe skits each cover separate topics of humanity and what it was like. It'll follow a group of characters each played by the Black Hole just with different clothes and wigs on, as they take part in the topic of the sketch while talking about it. Some times the show has \"guest stars\" on it that is just the Black Hole poorly imitating the stars voices. \n\nThe location the skits take place in changes every skit, sometimes it's a dentist office, movie theater, the top of a building, etc. Although each of them seem very off, in a weird way. Like little details are wrong, shadows aren't where they're supposed to be and other stuff that makes it seem eerie but not too much that it's a problem. It's kinda like the Black Hole painting a background that only uses the spoken information about it as a reference. \n\nThe comedy in the show is very dry humor as the Black Hole doesn't really understand exactly what the topic is and what comedy is in general.
