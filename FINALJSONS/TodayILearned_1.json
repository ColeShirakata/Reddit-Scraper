The last thing you'd want in your Burger King burger is someone's foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. With the statement: \"This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King.\" Admittedly, he had shoes on.\n\nBut that's even worse.\n\nThe post went live at 11:38 PM on July 16, and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. At least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three minutes later at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer. And three minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted: BK's \"Tell us about us\" online forum. The foot photo, otherwise known as exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said \"Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired.\" Mystery solved, by 4chan.

If he reproduced with someone else who has Hemophilia (HH), every child is guaranteed to have it. If he reproduces with someone who's a Carrier (Hh), approximately half the children will have it (HH) and the rest will be carriers (Hh).

So if there's a king who has it and had a bunch of kids with a woman who doesn't, and his kids are all carriers who marry non-carriers, and then their kids all still have a decent (1/4) chance of being carriers - so if these cousins start marrying and reproducing, there's a decent chance the next generation has Hemophiliacs in it.

Likewise and more so, a hug.  \n>  \n>Then he looked me up and down with increasing astonishment. I had a butterbar on, which seemed to annoy the piss out of him. He stuck his hatbrim in my eyes (I'm about 5'8\"), then proceeded to vocalize his dismay at the idea of a baby-lieutenant. Then he started speaking to me in Australian, which I thought, up to that time, resembled English.  \n>  \n>Not so. I think he informed me that it would be a cold day in hell before an *\u00fac \u0111\u1ea1i l\u1ee3i* Warrant Officer was outranked by a US Army 2nd LT, especially considering how the Army had lowered their standards to tolerate the idea of a twenty-year old officer, and I should NOT expect a salute from him or anyone like him forever.  \n>  \n>He finished up asking me if I understood. I didn't, but I assured him I did. I looked at the Gunny out of the corner of my eyes, and he smiled and nodded. Then the WO backed up, looked me up and down, decided something, punched me on the shoulder and said, \"Yer all right, Yank.\"  \n>  \n>First thing I understood completely that evening.

What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old constitution, were that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with, but the general opinion of the men of that day was that, somehow or other in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away. This idea, though not incorporated in the constitution, was the prevailing idea at that time. The constitution, it is true, secured every essential guarantee to the institution while it should last, and hence no argument can be justly urged against the constitutional guarantees thus secured, because of the common sentiment of the day. Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error.

And, of course, that is precisely what happened. Not only was Arlington House occupied for much of the War, but other Lee/Washington family properties were targeted as well, heirlooms were lost, and so on.\n\nIf he was trying to profit from this property, he could hardly have done a worse job.\n\n> I'm not sure what relevance your final point was? I never said anything about him being dumb or not a good soldier. Although, he is also one of the most overrated generals in history, thanks to Southern Lost Cause revisionism. He made a lot of enormous blunders that ultimately doomed the CSA's war efforts, blowing what small chance it had to achieve a settlement with the Union.\n\n> But I absolutely question his judgment, choices and character. I don't care how \"well-admired\" he was then, he ultimately served an evil cause, one he wouldn't have served if he indeed was being honest about how he felt about slavery.\n\nMy point was that there is much to be gained -- even just at a personal, intellectual level -- from making an effort to truly understand someone like Robert E. Lee within the context of his own life, his own time, and so on.\n\nI mention his intellect, his accomplishments, and so on to make the case that he is exactly the *wrong* sort of person to try to reduce to caricature.

In one incident involving a Georgian named Col. Bryant, who had recently decided not to whip one of his enslaved men for some transgression, a slave patrol showed up in the night to administer punishment themselves, upon which, as his daughter related:\n\nPa went out to protect him and they became dreadfully angry with him; said he \"upheld his negroes in their rascality.\"\n\nThe Colonel responded back that the speaker was a liar. A week later, one of the Colonel's horses was maliciously injured by an unknown person in the night, but presumably it was one of the patrollers returned to get their revenge.

Many were! Back in the day there were a lot of historians (including many feminist historians) who argued that white women were entirerly at the mercy of the men, and had no agency.

I can only speak from my own perspective.\n\nI learned it from a hostile home environment and childhood trauma. I began to unlearn it when I was in a better environment, when friends were able to give loving feedback, but most importantly because I wanted to make others happy. There was no particular seed that caused me to want to fix it, unfortunately, just loooots of feedback I already wanted to give me the perspective I lacked. I played with the deck stacked against me, then stacked for me, and I still only started to feel good about a decade after I feel like I had a firm grasp on what it was I was working on.\n\nMy mom most likely learned it from a hostile home environment and childhood trauma. She still does it to this day (her world pretty much revolves around it), and she enjoys the external validation she gets when she shares ... her \"perspective\" on situations with others.

My mom is not an integral part of my life, because I don't want that behavior in my environment. This caused her a lot of pain when my child was born. I know I can visit her once in a blue moon, she'll be happy to see me, ecstatic to see my daughter if she's with me, but I can't stay long, and I don't feel comfortable putting myself in a position where I'm reliant on her in any way.\n\nTo sum it up: Mom won't change because she doesn't want to, I changed because I wanted to, and though our defensive mechanisms were no doubt created by external circumstances, neither of us have had our intent/drive changed by external influences. This could be the norm, this could be a set of useless outliers.", "First, you're a person. I get what you mean, but reinforcing this helped me. Unless you're an AI, in which case, well played.\n\nFirst phase is recognition looking back. This is a pain in the ass to do. You have learned to react one way, and it makes sense. There is nothing right now - aside from the fact you can see it in retrospect - that has your back; you are going to have to build this over time. Learn to recognize this pattern of behavior in retrospect, but dig into it when you do so. Learn to identify commonalities in how you felt when it was happening. Were you overwhelmed? Did you feel external hostility? Did you feel close to someone? These are examples of the commonalities I have identified in my own pattern. This will take time to do, and you will probably develop distrust and anger toward yourself as a result of doing it right. You will essentially learn to not like specific things about what you did, as opposed to the outcomes, which is the tool you need for the second phase.\n\nSecond phase is recognition in the moment. This is a pain in the ass to do. You are going to identify things you are used to taking for granted - the things you identified in the first phase - in real time. This will take time to do, and you will probably feel frustrated that you are not doing enough quickly enough to fix the problems you are beginning to get good at identifying. Patience towards yourself and those around you is your friend here; rushing in to defend yourself probably got you into this pattern of behavior, and you are now working to do the opposite. More often than not, not reacting to a situation is the best reaction you can have at this phase; just processing it and understanding how it makes you feel gives you the opportunity to subvert your own pattern, as well as identify harmful patterns in the environment around you with better accuracy. \n\nThird phase is preparing for the future. This is awkward to do. You are going to shift from just being patient to (calmly) taking proactive measures. If you want someone in your life, tell them you have troubles with these things; either when they become issues for the first time, or when you become comfortable enough with the other person to share. People who have not had to go through these phases themselves usually lack the empathy/sympathy to understand where you are coming from, and it will be overwhelming to them. This is reasonable. You will hear a lot of \"no, you are not that person,\" but if you have shared before this point, you have probably already heard that plenty. You are the only person who knows how you have behaved in the past, what you do and do not like about it, and why you are trying to change. Take comfort in the fact they mean well, but do not discard your understanding of the situation in favor of theirs.\n\nI am at phase three. I do not know how or if it ends, but I feel like I am now at a common level of attempted growth in my life compared to others, which is comforting in its own way. I take pride in the fact that I can measure when I am comfortable enough to share it with someone new in my life. This does not happen in a vacuum though, and you are not the only person with negative behaviors; you will have to learn what that means for you as you go through it, but for me it meant putting up major walls between myself and my mom, and that I lost a lot of good relationships in the processing of it all.\n\ntl;dr Aim for patience and love where you probably currently have anxiety and fear.", "This is what I used to do.

While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was far from perfect, it did cut taxes on the middle class and fueled the economic growth that brought unemployment rates to half-century lows before the pandemic.\n\nThe 83% claim comes from a study by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and refers to rates in 2027, which is after almost all of the TCJA cuts of individual income taxes are slated to expire. A fairer benchmark is what would happen to taxes while the Trump cuts are still in place. In 2025, according to the Tax Policy Center, the top 1% would get 25% of the cut.

Instead, most are severe lesions, etc. Sharks aren't the villain. They are actually fundamentally crucial in a healthy ocean, and we as a species are fundamentally dependent on a healthy ocean to survive.", "That's why the best way to fend off a shark attack is to fart in its mouth", "Wow, that's really interesting! I had no idea that a shark's mouth is one of its sense organs. It's crazy to think that they use it to try and figure out what something is as a last resort. Nature truly never ceases to amaze me.

If they encounter something unknown, but can\u2019t taste/smell/hear/sense(electrically) it, then their last resort is to either ignore it or to put their mouth on it out of curiosity/frustration. Its been speculated that many minor shark bite attacks have been the result of a shark getting too curious or excited, the same as can happen with dogs.", "Wow, that's really interesting! Sharks are definitely one of the most fascinating creatures in the ocean. Did you know that some species have the ability to detect electric fields in the water around them? This helps them to locate prey and navigate the ocean. It's amazing how these animals have evolved to adapt to their environment.
