The senate passed the motion and needed to be confirmed by either Judicial or the Elections Committee. The Elections Committee then met and voted in favor of a new election which is why candidates started to campaign again and Elections made the announcement on their Instagram. \n\nWe are now hearing that the Elections Committee felt pressured to vote and wanted to revote on having a new election. They redid their vote and are now retracting their original decision and if this stays there will NOT be a new election. \n\nThis will be discussed at tonight's senate meeting and any student is allowed to speak during public comment.

I wasn't at the meeting but I know a couple of folks who did attend so I made a report since policing is a big issue for the community. This is also the first open public meeting they've had.\n\nRegarding mental health, UCPD has stated they are in the midsts of hiring mobile mental health professionals to respond to crisis. They say once these professionals are hired, they will respond to calls instead of UCPD officers. This is referring to their SWIFT mental health advocates.\n\nAs an aside- One of the community concerns for this effort is that recently, the UC campuses mental health practitioners have reported that most UCs are unable to recruit qualified staff to work on these mobile crisis teams. Schools which have successfully implemented this are UCSC and UCSD,respectively. Without these mobile units operational, police intervention is the only response available for students in crisis. It should be noted that UCR's plans for a mobile mental health team have been ongoing for at least two years now. No clarification was given regarding what caused the multiple year delay for the program's launch.\n\nSecondly, an undergraduate student mentioned there was a police call placed on a group of striking union members during their efforts to liberate the Glascow dining hall. What this is in reference to is that during the Winter 2022 TA strike, a smaller group of union members demonstrated protest by physically blocking the exit and entry doors of dining halls across the UC system to allow students to walk in and out of the dining hall without needing to pay, hence the term \"liberation\". It was mentioned that UCR was the only UC campus to have the police called on them while performing this demonstration.

The senate passed the motion and needed to be confirmed by either Judicial or the Elections Committee. The Elections Committee then met and voted in favor of a new election which is why candidates started to campaign again and Elections made the announcement on their Instagram. \n\nWe are now hearing that the Elections Committee felt pressured to vote and wanted to revote on having a new election. They redid their vote and are now retracting their original decision and if this stays there will NOT be a new election. \n\nThis will be discussed at tonight's senate meeting and any student is allowed to speak during public comment. The meeting is tonight at 7pm in the ASUCR Senate Chambers on the second floor of the HUB. \n\nPlease see the following threads if you need more context about what is going on: \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1357zoc/asucr\\_redoing\\_their\\_election/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1357zoc/asucr_redoing_their_election/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/130ad8j/asucr\\_meeting\\_426\\_summary/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/130ad8j/asucr_meeting_426_summary/)\n\nEDIT: You can also attend the meeting virtually via zoom \nhttps://ucr.zoom.us/j/94545626447", "id": "1374lej", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1374lej/asucr_new_election_decision_to_be_revoked/", "created_utc": 1683160204.0, "score": 11, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1374lej/asucr_new_election_decision_to_be_revoked/", "comments": ["ALRIGHT!

I wasn't at the meeting but I know a couple of folks who did attend so I made a report since policing is a big issue for the community. This is also the first open public meeting they've had.\n\nRegarding mental health, UCPD has stated they are in the midsts of hiring mobile mental health professionals to respond to crisis. They say once these professionals are hired, they will respond to calls instead of UCPD officers. This is referring to their SWIFT mental health advocates.\n\nAs an aside- One of the community concerns for this effort is that recently, the UC campuses mental health practitioners have reported that most UCs are unable to recruit qualified staff to work on these mobile crisis teams. Schools which have successfully implemented this are UCSC and UCSD,respectively. Without these mobile units operational, police intervention is the only response available for students in crisis. It should be noted that UCR's plans for a mobile mental health team have been ongoing for at least two years now. No clarification was given regarding what caused the multiple year delay for the program's launch.\n\nSecondly, an undergraduate student mentioned there was a police call placed on a group of striking union members during their efforts to liberate the Glascow dining hall. What this is in reference to is that during the Winter 2022 TA strike, a smaller group of union members demonstrated protest by physically blocking the exit and entry doors of dining halls across the UC system to allow students to walk in and out of the dining hall without needing to pay, hence the term \"liberation\". It was mentioned that UCR was the only UC campus to have the police called on them while performing this demonstration. Community members urged that this incident was documented through social media, so it did in fact, was witnessed by part of the campus community. UCR Admin initially stated to no clue what the student was referring to. However, once more folks mentioned the incident, they backpedaled and stated they knew of the call but emphasized they did not send police.  \n\nFact check wise, I personally remember witnessing the police block the streets leading to Glascow and intervening. Other community members reportedly also stated this as well during the meeting. So it's not clear why UCR admin and UCPD would say otherwise at the police accountability meeting...\n\nAnyway this is where the conversation about campus safety stands.", "id": "1360vlo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "created_utc": 1683062919.0, "score": 13, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "comments": ["Boyfriends catalytic converter was stolen twice right across the street and they didn\u2019t do anything.

The senate passed the motion and needed to be confirmed by either Judicial or the Elections Committee. The Elections Committee then met and voted in favor of a new election which is why candidates started to campaign again and Elections made the announcement on their Instagram. \n\nWe are now hearing that the Elections Committee felt pressured to vote and wanted to revote on having a new election. They redid their vote and are now retracting their original decision and if this stays there will NOT be a new election. \n\nThis will be discussed at tonight's senate meeting and any student is allowed to speak during public comment.

I wasn't at the meeting but I know a couple of folks who did attend so I made a report since policing is a big issue for the community. This is also the first open public meeting they've had.\n\nRegarding mental health, UCPD has stated they are in the midsts of hiring mobile mental health professionals to respond to crisis. They say once these professionals are hired, they will respond to calls instead of UCPD officers. This is referring to their SWIFT mental health advocates.\n\nAs an aside- One of the community concerns for this effort is that recently, the UC campuses mental health practitioners have reported that most UCs are unable to recruit qualified staff to work on these mobile crisis teams. Schools which have successfully implemented this are UCSC and UCSD,respectively. Without these mobile units operational, police intervention is the only response available for students in crisis. It should be noted that UCR's plans for a mobile mental health team have been ongoing for at least two years now. No clarification was given regarding what caused the multiple year delay for the program's launch.\n\nSecondly, an undergraduate student mentioned there was a police call placed on a group of striking union members during their efforts to liberate the Glascow dining hall. What this is in reference to is that during the Winter 2022 TA strike, a smaller group of union members demonstrated protest by physically blocking the exit and entry doors of dining halls across the UC system to allow students to walk in and out of the dining hall without needing to pay, hence the term \"liberation\". It was mentioned that UCR was the only UC campus to have the police called on them while performing this demonstration. Community members urged that this incident was documented through social media, so it did in fact, was witnessed by part of the campus community. UCR Admin initially stated to no clue what the student was referring to. However, once more folks mentioned the incident, they backpedaled and stated they knew of the call but emphasized they did not send police.  \n\nFact check wise, I personally remember witnessing the police block the streets leading to Glascow and intervening. Other community members reportedly also stated this as well during the meeting. So it's not clear why UCR admin and UCPD would say otherwise at the police accountability meeting...\n\nAnyway this is where the conversation about campus safety stands.", "id": "1360vlo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "created_utc": 1683062919.0, "score": 12, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "comments": ["Boyfriends catalytic converter was stolen twice right across the street and they didn\u2019t do anything.

The senate passed the motion and needed to be confirmed by either Judicial or the Elections Committee. The Elections Committee then met and voted in favor of a new election which is why candidates started to campaign again and Elections made the announcement on their Instagram. \n\nWe are now hearing that the Elections Committee felt pressured to vote and wanted to revote on having a new election. They redid their vote and are now retracting their original decision and if this stays there will NOT be a new election. \n\nThis will be discussed at tonight's senate meeting and any student is allowed to speak during public comment. The meeting is tonight at 7pm in the ASUCR Senate Chambers on the second floor of the HUB. \n\nPlease see the following threads if you need more context about what is going on: \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1357zoc/asucr\\_redoing\\_their\\_election/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1357zoc/asucr_redoing_their_election/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/130ad8j/asucr\\_meeting\\_426\\_summary/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/130ad8j/asucr_meeting_426_summary/)\n\nEDIT: You can also attend the meeting virtually via zoom \nhttps://ucr.zoom.us/j/94545626447", "id": "1374lej", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1374lej/asucr_new_election_decision_to_be_revoked/", "created_utc": 1683160204.0, "score": 10, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1374lej/asucr_new_election_decision_to_be_revoked/", "comments": ["ALRIGHT!

I wasn't at the meeting but I know a couple of folks who did attend so I made a report since policing is a big issue for the community. This is also the first open public meeting they've had.\n\nRegarding mental health, UCPD has stated they are in the midsts of hiring mobile mental health professionals to respond to crisis. They say once these professionals are hired, they will respond to calls instead of UCPD officers. This is referring to their SWIFT mental health advocates.\n\nAs an aside- One of the community concerns for this effort is that recently, the UC campuses mental health practitioners have reported that most UCs are unable to recruit qualified staff to work on these mobile crisis teams. Schools which have successfully implemented this are UCSC and UCSD,respectively. Without these mobile units operational, police intervention is the only response available for students in crisis. It should be noted that UCR's plans for a mobile mental health team have been ongoing for at least two years now. No clarification was given regarding what caused the multiple year delay for the program's launch.\n\nSecondly, an undergraduate student mentioned there was a police call placed on a group of striking union members during their efforts to liberate the Glascow dining hall. What this is in reference to is that during the Winter 2022 TA strike, a smaller group of union members demonstrated protest by physically blocking the exit and entry doors of dining halls across the UC system to allow students to walk in and out of the dining hall without needing to pay, hence the term \"liberation\". It was mentioned that UCR was the only UC campus to have the police called on them while performing this demonstration. Community members urged that this incident was documented through social media, so it did in fact, was witnessed by part of the campus community. UCR Admin initially stated to no clue what the student was referring to. However, once more folks mentioned the incident, they backpedaled and stated they knew of the call but emphasized they did not send police.  \n\nFact check wise, I personally remember witnessing the police block the streets leading to Glascow and intervening. Other community members reportedly also stated this as well during the meeting. So it's not clear why UCR admin and UCPD would say otherwise at the police accountability meeting...\n\nAnyway this is where the conversation about campus safety stands.", "id": "1360vlo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "created_utc": 1683062919.0, "score": 13, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "comments": ["Boyfriends catalytic converter was stolen twice right across the street and they didn\u2019t do anything.

I wasn't at the meeting but I know a couple of folks who did attend so I made a report since policing is a big issue for the community. This is also the first open public meeting they've had.\n\nRegarding mental health, UCPD has stated they are in the midsts of hiring mobile mental health professionals to respond to crisis. They say once these professionals are hired, they will respond to calls instead of UCPD officers. This is referring to their SWIFT mental health advocates.\n\nAs an aside- One of the community concerns for this effort is that recently, the UC campuses mental health practitioners have reported that most UCs are unable to recruit qualified staff to work on these mobile crisis teams. Schools which have successfully implemented this are UCSC and UCSD,respectively. Without these mobile units operational, police intervention is the only response available for students in crisis. It should be noted that UCR's plans for a mobile mental health team have been ongoing for at least two years now. No clarification was given regarding what caused the multiple year delay for the program's launch.\n\nSecondly, an undergraduate student mentioned there was a police call placed on a group of striking union members during their efforts to liberate the Glascow dining hall. What this is in reference to is that during the Winter 2022 TA strike, a smaller group of union members demonstrated protest by physically blocking the exit and entry doors of dining halls across the UC system to allow students to walk in and out of the dining hall without needing to pay, hence the term \"liberation\". It was mentioned that UCR was the only UC campus to have the police called on them while performing this demonstration. Community members urged that this incident was documented through social media, so it did in fact, was witnessed by part of the campus community. UCR Admin initially stated to no clue what the student was referring to. However, once more folks mentioned the incident, they backpedaled and stated they knew of the call but emphasized they did not send police.  \n\nFact check wise, I personally remember witnessing the police block the streets leading to Glascow and intervening. Other community members reportedly also stated this as well during the meeting. So it's not clear why UCR admin and UCPD would say otherwise at the police accountability meeting...\n\nAnyway this is where the conversation about campus safety stands.", "id": "1360vlo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "created_utc": 1683062919.0, "score": 12, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "comments": ["Boyfriends catalytic converter was stolen twice right across the street and they didn\u2019t do anything.

(a) Going on to grad school, where undergrad research and professors recommendations would help or (b) getting a job with an undergrad degree, probably not in her major.  \n\n\nI know it's her choice and I am not sure it ultimately matters, but I'd love to hear some actual opinions for or against in the two scenarios above.", "id": "138sbng", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/138sbng/comparing_ucr_honors_with_ucsb_neuroscience_and/", "created_utc": 1683300865.0, "score": 3, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/138sbng/comparing_ucr_honors_with_ucsb_neuroscience_and/", "comments": ["If she doesn't know what she wants to do I would go to the one with better location and reputation.

It\u2019s a great program at UCR and it will be easier for her to get into a lab and help out to gain more experience. If she wants to go to medical school, ucr has an awesome program and that can help her get in more smoothly (Thomas Haider Program).\n\nI personally chose research and it is true, I am not doing research in my major at the moment.

It is still the top 100 university in the nation and is honestly an awesome university with amazing students. Just because your daughter got into UCR doesn\u2019t mean that she is less. She can do great things there as long as she is optimistic about it. Please do not put the mentality that UCR is an ehh school, it will change her aspect on the school and she might not be as proactive.

The senate passed the motion and needed to be confirmed by either Judicial or the Elections Committee. The Elections Committee then met and voted in favor of a new election which is why candidates started to campaign again and Elections made the announcement on their Instagram. \n\nWe are now hearing that the Elections Committee felt pressured to vote and wanted to revote on having a new election. They redid their vote and are now retracting their original decision and if this stays there will NOT be a new election. \n\nThis will be discussed at tonight's senate meeting and any student is allowed to speak during public comment.

The senate passed the motion and needed to be confirmed by either Judicial or the Elections Committee. The Elections Committee then met and voted in favor of a new election which is why candidates started to campaign again and Elections made the announcement on their Instagram. \n\nWe are now hearing that the Elections Committee felt pressured to vote and wanted to revote on having a new election. They redid their vote and are now retracting their original decision and if this stays there will NOT be a new election. \n\nThis will be discussed at tonight's senate meeting and any student is allowed to speak during public comment.

I wasn't at the meeting but I know a couple of folks who did attend so I made a report since policing is a big issue for the community. This is also the first open public meeting they've had.\n\nRegarding mental health, UCPD has stated they are in the midsts of hiring mobile mental health professionals to respond to crisis. They say once these professionals are hired, they will respond to calls instead of UCPD officers. This is referring to their SWIFT mental health advocates.\n\nAs an aside- One of the community concerns for this effort is that recently, the UC campuses mental health practitioners have reported that most UCs are unable to recruit qualified staff to work on these mobile crisis teams. Schools which have successfully implemented this are UCSC and UCSD,respectively. Without these mobile units operational, police intervention is the only response available for students in crisis. It should be noted that UCR's plans for a mobile mental health team have been ongoing for at least two years now. No clarification was given regarding what caused the multiple year delay for the program's launch.\n\nSecondly, an undergraduate student mentioned there was a police call placed on a group of striking union members during their efforts to liberate the Glascow dining hall. What this is in reference to is that during the Winter 2022 TA strike, a smaller group of union members demonstrated protest by physically blocking the exit and entry doors of dining halls across the UC system to allow students to walk in and out of the dining hall without needing to pay, hence the term \"liberation\". It was mentioned that UCR was the only UC campus to have the police called on them while performing this demonstration. Community members urged that this incident was documented through social media, so it did in fact, was witnessed by part of the campus community. UCR Admin initially stated to no clue what the student was referring to. However, once more folks mentioned the incident, they backpedaled and stated they knew of the call but emphasized they did not send police.  \n\nFact check wise, I personally remember witnessing the police block the streets leading to Glascow and intervening. Other community members reportedly also stated this as well during the meeting. So it's not clear why UCR admin and UCPD would say otherwise at the police accountability meeting...\n\nAnyway this is where the conversation about campus safety stands.", "id": "1360vlo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "created_utc": 1683062919.0, "score": 12, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "comments": ["Boyfriends catalytic converter was stolen twice right across the street and they didn\u2019t do anything.

It\u2019s up to her, I think it would be great if you guys were able to take her to both schools and get the feel of the area. \n\nI also majored in Neuroscience. It\u2019s a great program at UCR and it will be easier for her to get into a lab and help out to gain more experience. If she wants to go to medical school, ucr has an awesome program and that can help her get in more smoothly (Thomas Haider Program).\n\nI personally chose research and it is true, I am not doing research in my major at the moment. I wanted something more diverse coming out of college because Neuroscience made me feel like i was in a box. I am planning to apply to grad school in a year after i\u2019ve gained enough experience.\n\nEdit: I\u2019d also like to note that just because UCR is not ranked as highly as the other UCs does not mean that it is less. It is still the top 100 university in the nation and is honestly an awesome university with amazing students. Just because your daughter got into UCR doesn\u2019t mean that she is less. She can do great things there as long as she is optimistic about it. Please do not put the mentality that UCR is an ehh school, it will change her aspect on the school and she might not be as proactive. Both these offers are amazing and I hope she chooses one that fits her the most.", "If she doesn't know what she wants to do I would go to the one with better location and reputation. That's what my counselor told me and it worked out for me (I'm a PhD student here but did my undergrad elsewhere)", "Thanks! That's really useful advice. I think I have a clearer idea of neuroscience than Psychological and Brain Sciences. How do these programs compare? I don't think she has all that strong an opinion on what she wants to do. In fact she applied to cognitive science at places that have that specific program. She also says she's not really interested in medical school.  \n\n\nI was actually really excited when she got into the honors program because I felt it would put her in closer contact with professors who could write strong recommendation letters. But now I wonder if I oversold it to her, because as a parent, I personally think going with UCSB is a safer option for putting on your resume.", "\"better location and reputation\" And to be clear, that means UCSB, right? I have actually warmed up to UCR (both as a school and to the Inland Empire). My son goes there now. I thought my daughter would have more options with her grades, but she did not until the waitlist opened up. We're still waiting on some others.", "UCR will give her a better financial aid package. If she\u2019s already happy about UCR, she will do very well here. Going to a school just for prestige isn\u2019t always the best choice. The comment above yours has really weird takes on UCR and likes to criticize it a lot. She will have a lot of opportunities to do well here and there are many resources to help her succeed!", "Well we're unlikely to get a financial aid package at either. I do have warm feelings about UCR and my son goes there. There's way too much negativity in my view. I'm coming from NorCal and I think Riverside is a nice city. The UCR campus reminds me of my alma mater (public in a different state, also with agriculture roots) though UCR's campus is smaller. I loved that weird old radio station building, and some of the landscaping is also beautiful.  \n\n\nStill we'd have definitely gone with UCSB if they had accepted at the same time.

The senate passed the motion and needed to be confirmed by either Judicial or the Elections Committee. The Elections Committee then met and voted in favor of a new election which is why candidates started to campaign again and Elections made the announcement on their Instagram. \n\nWe are now hearing that the Elections Committee felt pressured to vote and wanted to revote on having a new election. They redid their vote and are now retracting their original decision and if this stays there will NOT be a new election. \n\nThis will be discussed at tonight's senate meeting and any student is allowed to speak during public comment.

I wasn't at the meeting but I know a couple of folks who did attend so I made a report since policing is a big issue for the community. This is also the first open public meeting they've had.\n\nRegarding mental health, UCPD has stated they are in the midsts of hiring mobile mental health professionals to respond to crisis. They say once these professionals are hired, they will respond to calls instead of UCPD officers. This is referring to their SWIFT mental health advocates.\n\nAs an aside- One of the community concerns for this effort is that recently, the UC campuses mental health practitioners have reported that most UCs are unable to recruit qualified staff to work on these mobile crisis teams. Schools which have successfully implemented this are UCSC and UCSD,respectively. Without these mobile units operational, police intervention is the only response available for students in crisis. It should be noted that UCR's plans for a mobile mental health team have been ongoing for at least two years now. No clarification was given regarding what caused the multiple year delay for the program's launch.\n\nSecondly, an undergraduate student mentioned there was a police call placed on a group of striking union members during their efforts to liberate the Glascow dining hall. What this is in reference to is that during the Winter 2022 TA strike, a smaller group of union members demonstrated protest by physically blocking the exit and entry doors of dining halls across the UC system to allow students to walk in and out of the dining hall without needing to pay, hence the term \"liberation\". It was mentioned that UCR was the only UC campus to have the police called on them while performing this demonstration. Community members urged that this incident was documented through social media, so it did in fact, was witnessed by part of the campus community. UCR Admin initially stated to no clue what the student was referring to. However, once more folks mentioned the incident, they backpedaled and stated they knew of the call but emphasized they did not send police.  \n\nFact check wise, I personally remember witnessing the police block the streets leading to Glascow and intervening. Other community members reportedly also stated this as well during the meeting. So it's not clear why UCR admin and UCPD would say otherwise at the police accountability meeting...\n\nAnyway this is where the conversation about campus safety stands.", "id": "1360vlo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "created_utc": 1683062919.0, "score": 11, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "comments": ["Boyfriends catalytic converter was stolen twice right across the street and they didn\u2019t do anything.

The senate passed the motion and needed to be confirmed by either Judicial or the Elections Committee. The Elections Committee then met and voted in favor of a new election which is why candidates started to campaign again and Elections made the announcement on their Instagram. \n\nWe are now hearing that the Elections Committee felt pressured to vote and wanted to revote on having a new election. They redid their vote and are now retracting their original decision and if this stays there will NOT be a new election. \n\nThis will be discussed at tonight's senate meeting and any student is allowed to speak during public comment.

I wasn't at the meeting but I know a couple of folks who did attend so I made a report since policing is a big issue for the community. This is also the first open public meeting they've had.\n\nRegarding mental health, UCPD has stated they are in the midsts of hiring mobile mental health professionals to respond to crisis. They say once these professionals are hired, they will respond to calls instead of UCPD officers. This is referring to their SWIFT mental health advocates.\n\nAs an aside- One of the community concerns for this effort is that recently, the UC campuses mental health practitioners have reported that most UCs are unable to recruit qualified staff to work on these mobile crisis teams. Schools which have successfully implemented this are UCSC and UCSD,respectively. Without these mobile units operational, police intervention is the only response available for students in crisis. It should be noted that UCR's plans for a mobile mental health team have been ongoing for at least two years now. No clarification was given regarding what caused the multiple year delay for the program's launch.\n\nSecondly, an undergraduate student mentioned there was a police call placed on a group of striking union members during their efforts to liberate the Glascow dining hall. What this is in reference to is that during the Winter 2022 TA strike, a smaller group of union members demonstrated protest by physically blocking the exit and entry doors of dining halls across the UC system to allow students to walk in and out of the dining hall without needing to pay, hence the term \"liberation\". It was mentioned that UCR was the only UC campus to have the police called on them while performing this demonstration. Community members urged that this incident was documented through social media, so it did in fact, was witnessed by part of the campus community. UCR Admin initially stated to no clue what the student was referring to. However, once more folks mentioned the incident, they backpedaled and stated they knew of the call but emphasized they did not send police.  \n\nFact check wise, I personally remember witnessing the police block the streets leading to Glascow and intervening. Other community members reportedly also stated this as well during the meeting. So it's not clear why UCR admin and UCPD would say otherwise at the police accountability meeting...\n\nAnyway this is where the conversation about campus safety stands.", "id": "1360vlo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "created_utc": 1683062919.0, "score": 13, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "comments": ["Boyfriends catalytic converter was stolen twice right across the street and they didn\u2019t do anything.

I wasn't at the meeting but I know a couple of folks who did attend so I made a report since policing is a big issue for the community. This is also the first open public meeting they've had.\n\nRegarding mental health, UCPD has stated they are in the midsts of hiring mobile mental health professionals to respond to crisis. They say once these professionals are hired, they will respond to calls instead of UCPD officers. This is referring to their SWIFT mental health advocates.\n\nAs an aside- One of the community concerns for this effort is that recently, the UC campuses mental health practitioners have reported that most UCs are unable to recruit qualified staff to work on these mobile crisis teams. Schools which have successfully implemented this are UCSC and UCSD,respectively. Without these mobile units operational, police intervention is the only response available for students in crisis. It should be noted that UCR's plans for a mobile mental health team have been ongoing for at least two years now. No clarification was given regarding what caused the multiple year delay for the program's launch.\n\nSecondly, an undergraduate student mentioned there was a police call placed on a group of striking union members during their efforts to liberate the Glascow dining hall. What this is in reference to is that during the Winter 2022 TA strike, a smaller group of union members demonstrated protest by physically blocking the exit and entry doors of dining halls across the UC system to allow students to walk in and out of the dining hall without needing to pay, hence the term \"liberation\". It was mentioned that UCR was the only UC campus to have the police called on them while performing this demonstration. Community members urged that this incident was documented through social media, so it did in fact, was witnessed by part of the campus community. UCR Admin initially stated to no clue what the student was referring to. However, once more folks mentioned the incident, they backpedaled and stated they knew of the call but emphasized they did not send police.  \n\nFact check wise, I personally remember witnessing the police block the streets leading to Glascow and intervening. Other community members reportedly also stated this as well during the meeting. So it's not clear why UCR admin and UCPD would say otherwise at the police accountability meeting...\n\nAnyway this is where the conversation about campus safety stands.", "id": "1360vlo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "created_utc": 1683062919.0, "score": 12, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "comments": ["Boyfriends catalytic converter was stolen twice right across the street and they didn\u2019t do anything.

The senate passed the motion and needed to be confirmed by either Judicial or the Elections Committee. The Elections Committee then met and voted in favor of a new election which is why candidates started to campaign again and Elections made the announcement on their Instagram. \n\nWe are now hearing that the Elections Committee felt pressured to vote and wanted to revote on having a new election. They redid their vote and are now retracting their original decision and if this stays there will NOT be a new election. \n\nThis will be discussed at tonight's senate meeting and any student is allowed to speak during public comment.

I wasn't at the meeting but I know a couple of folks who did attend so I made a report since policing is a big issue for the community. This is also the first open public meeting they've had.\n\nRegarding mental health, UCPD has stated they are in the midsts of hiring mobile mental health professionals to respond to crisis. They say once these professionals are hired, they will respond to calls instead of UCPD officers. This is referring to their SWIFT mental health advocates.\n\nAs an aside- One of the community concerns for this effort is that recently, the UC campuses mental health practitioners have reported that most UCs are unable to recruit qualified staff to work on these mobile crisis teams. Schools which have successfully implemented this are UCSC and UCSD,respectively. Without these mobile units operational, police intervention is the only response available for students in crisis. It should be noted that UCR's plans for a mobile mental health team have been ongoing for at least two years now. No clarification was given regarding what caused the multiple year delay for the program's launch.\n\nSecondly, an undergraduate student mentioned there was a police call placed on a group of striking union members during their efforts to liberate the Glascow dining hall. What this is in reference to is that during the Winter 2022 TA strike, a smaller group of union members demonstrated protest by physically blocking the exit and entry doors of dining halls across the UC system to allow students to walk in and out of the dining hall without needing to pay, hence the term \"liberation\". It was mentioned that UCR was the only UC campus to have the police called on them while performing this demonstration. Community members urged that this incident was documented through social media, so it did in fact, was witnessed by part of the campus community. UCR Admin initially stated to no clue what the student was referring to. However, once more folks mentioned the incident, they backpedaled and stated they knew of the call but emphasized they did not send police.  \n\nFact check wise, I personally remember witnessing the police block the streets leading to Glascow and intervening. Other community members reportedly also stated this as well during the meeting. So it's not clear why UCR admin and UCPD would say otherwise at the police accountability meeting...\n\nAnyway this is where the conversation about campus safety stands.", "id": "1360vlo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "created_utc": 1683062919.0, "score": 11, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "comments": ["Boyfriends catalytic converter was stolen twice right across the street and they didn\u2019t do anything.

The senate passed the motion and needed to be confirmed by either Judicial or the Elections Committee. The Elections Committee then met and voted in favor of a new election which is why candidates started to campaign again and Elections made the announcement on their Instagram. \n\nWe are now hearing that the Elections Committee felt pressured to vote and wanted to revote on having a new election. They redid their vote and are now retracting their original decision and if this stays there will NOT be a new election. \n\nThis will be discussed at tonight's senate meeting and any student is allowed to speak during public comment.

I wasn't at the meeting but I know a couple of folks who did attend so I made a report since policing is a big issue for the community. This is also the first open public meeting they've had.\n\nRegarding mental health, UCPD has stated they are in the midsts of hiring mobile mental health professionals to respond to crisis. They say once these professionals are hired, they will respond to calls instead of UCPD officers. This is referring to their SWIFT mental health advocates.\n\nAs an aside- One of the community concerns for this effort is that recently, the UC campuses mental health practitioners have reported that most UCs are unable to recruit qualified staff to work on these mobile crisis teams. Schools which have successfully implemented this are UCSC and UCSD,respectively. Without these mobile units operational, police intervention is the only response available for students in crisis. It should be noted that UCR's plans for a mobile mental health team have been ongoing for at least two years now. No clarification was given regarding what caused the multiple year delay for the program's launch.\n\nSecondly, an undergraduate student mentioned there was a police call placed on a group of striking union members during their efforts to liberate the Glascow dining hall. What this is in reference to is that during the Winter 2022 TA strike, a smaller group of union members demonstrated protest by physically blocking the exit and entry doors of dining halls across the UC system to allow students to walk in and out of the dining hall without needing to pay, hence the term \"liberation\". It was mentioned that UCR was the only UC campus to have the police called on them while performing this demonstration. Community members urged that this incident was documented through social media, so it did in fact, was witnessed by part of the campus community. UCR Admin initially stated to no clue what the student was referring to. However, once more folks mentioned the incident, they backpedaled and stated they knew of the call but emphasized they did not send police.  \n\nFact check wise, I personally remember witnessing the police block the streets leading to Glascow and intervening. Other community members reportedly also stated this as well during the meeting. So it's not clear why UCR admin and UCPD would say otherwise at the police accountability meeting...\n\nAnyway this is where the conversation about campus safety stands.", "id": "1360vlo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "created_utc": 1683062919.0, "score": 11, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "comments": ["Boyfriends catalytic converter was stolen twice right across the street and they didn\u2019t do anything.

The senate passed the motion and needed to be confirmed by either Judicial or the Elections Committee. The Elections Committee then met and voted in favor of a new election which is why candidates started to campaign again and Elections made the announcement on their Instagram. \n\nWe are now hearing that the Elections Committee felt pressured to vote and wanted to revote on having a new election. They redid their vote and are now retracting their original decision and if this stays there will NOT be a new election. \n\nThis will be discussed at tonight's senate meeting and any student is allowed to speak during public comment. The meeting is tonight at 7pm in the ASUCR Senate Chambers on the second floor of the HUB. \n\nPlease see the following threads if you need more context about what is going on: \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1357zoc/asucr\\_redoing\\_their\\_election/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1357zoc/asucr_redoing_their_election/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/130ad8j/asucr\\_meeting\\_426\\_summary/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/130ad8j/asucr_meeting_426_summary/)\n\nEDIT: You can also attend the meeting virtually via zoom \nhttps://ucr.zoom.us/j/94545626447", "id": "1374lej", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1374lej/asucr_new_election_decision_to_be_revoked/", "created_utc": 1683160204.0, "score": 9, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1374lej/asucr_new_election_decision_to_be_revoked/", "comments": ["ALRIGHT!

I wasn't at the meeting but I know a couple of folks who did attend so I made a report since policing is a big issue for the community. This is also the first open public meeting they've had.\n\nRegarding mental health, UCPD has stated they are in the midsts of hiring mobile mental health professionals to respond to crisis. They say once these professionals are hired, they will respond to calls instead of UCPD officers. This is referring to their SWIFT mental health advocates.\n\nAs an aside- One of the community concerns for this effort is that recently, the UC campuses mental health practitioners have reported that most UCs are unable to recruit qualified staff to work on these mobile crisis teams. Schools which have successfully implemented this are UCSC and UCSD,respectively. Without these mobile units operational, police intervention is the only response available for students in crisis. It should be noted that UCR's plans for a mobile mental health team have been ongoing for at least two years now. No clarification was given regarding what caused the multiple year delay for the program's launch.\n\nSecondly, an undergraduate student mentioned there was a police call placed on a group of striking union members during their efforts to liberate the Glascow dining hall. What this is in reference to is that during the Winter 2022 TA strike, a smaller group of union members demonstrated protest by physically blocking the exit and entry doors of dining halls across the UC system to allow students to walk in and out of the dining hall without needing to pay, hence the term \"liberation\". It was mentioned that UCR was the only UC campus to have the police called on them while performing this demonstration. Community members urged that this incident was documented through social media, so it did in fact, was witnessed by part of the campus community. UCR Admin initially stated to no clue what the student was referring to. However, once more folks mentioned the incident, they backpedaled and stated they knew of the call but emphasized they did not send police.  \n\nFact check wise, I personally remember witnessing the police block the streets leading to Glascow and intervening. Other community members reportedly also stated this as well during the meeting. So it's not clear why UCR admin and UCPD would say otherwise at the police accountability meeting...\n\nAnyway this is where the conversation about campus safety stands.", "id": "1360vlo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "created_utc": 1683062919.0, "score": 12, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "comments": ["Boyfriends catalytic converter was stolen twice right across the street and they didn\u2019t do anything.

The senate passed the motion and needed to be confirmed by either Judicial or the Elections Committee. The Elections Committee then met and voted in favor of a new election which is why candidates started to campaign again and Elections made the announcement on their Instagram. \n\nWe are now hearing that the Elections Committee felt pressured to vote and wanted to revote on having a new election. They redid their vote and are now retracting their original decision and if this stays there will NOT be a new election. \n\nThis will be discussed at tonight's senate meeting and any student is allowed to speak during public comment.

I wasn't at the meeting but I know a couple of folks who did attend so I made a report since policing is a big issue for the community. This is also the first open public meeting they've had.\n\nRegarding mental health, UCPD has stated they are in the midsts of hiring mobile mental health professionals to respond to crisis. They say once these professionals are hired, they will respond to calls instead of UCPD officers. This is referring to their SWIFT mental health advocates.\n\nAs an aside- One of the community concerns for this effort is that recently, the UC campuses mental health practitioners have reported that most UCs are unable to recruit qualified staff to work on these mobile crisis teams. Schools which have successfully implemented this are UCSC and UCSD,respectively. Without these mobile units operational, police intervention is the only response available for students in crisis. It should be noted that UCR's plans for a mobile mental health team have been ongoing for at least two years now. No clarification was given regarding what caused the multiple year delay for the program's launch.\n\nSecondly, an undergraduate student mentioned there was a police call placed on a group of striking union members during their efforts to liberate the Glascow dining hall. What this is in reference to is that during the Winter 2022 TA strike, a smaller group of union members demonstrated protest by physically blocking the exit and entry doors of dining halls across the UC system to allow students to walk in and out of the dining hall without needing to pay, hence the term \"liberation\". It was mentioned that UCR was the only UC campus to have the police called on them while performing this demonstration. Community members urged that this incident was documented through social media, so it did in fact, was witnessed by part of the campus community. UCR Admin initially stated to no clue what the student was referring to. However, once more folks mentioned the incident, they backpedaled and stated they knew of the call but emphasized they did not send police.  \n\nFact check wise, I personally remember witnessing the police block the streets leading to Glascow and intervening. Other community members reportedly also stated this as well during the meeting. So it's not clear why UCR admin and UCPD would say otherwise at the police accountability meeting...\n\nAnyway this is where the conversation about campus safety stands.", "id": "1360vlo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "created_utc": 1683062919.0, "score": 12, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "comments": ["Boyfriends catalytic converter was stolen twice right across the street and they didn\u2019t do anything.

The senate passed the motion and needed to be confirmed by either Judicial or the Elections Committee. The Elections Committee then met and voted in favor of a new election which is why candidates started to campaign again and Elections made the announcement on their Instagram. \n\nWe are now hearing that the Elections Committee felt pressured to vote and wanted to revote on having a new election. They redid their vote and are now retracting their original decision and if this stays there will NOT be a new election. \n\nThis will be discussed at tonight's senate meeting and any student is allowed to speak during public comment.

The Elections Committee then met and voted in favor of a new election which is why candidates started to campaign again and Elections made the announcement on their Instagram. \n\nWe are now hearing that the Elections Committee felt pressured to vote and wanted to revote on having a new election.

The meeting is tonight at 7pm in the ASUCR Senate Chambers on the second floor of the HUB. \n\nPlease see the following threads if you need more context about what is going on: \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1357zoc/asucr\\_redoing\\_their\\_election/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1357zoc/asucr_redoing_their_election/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/130ad8j/asucr\\_meeting\\_426\\_summary/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/130ad8j/asucr_meeting_426_summary/)\n\nEDIT: You can also attend the meeting virtually via zoom \nhttps://ucr.zoom.us/j/94545626447", "id": "1374lej", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1374lej/asucr_new_election_decision_to_be_revoked/", "created_utc": 1683160204.0, "score": 10, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1374lej/asucr_new_election_decision_to_be_revoked/", "comments": ["ALRIGHT!

I wasn't at the meeting but I know a couple of folks who did attend so I made a report since policing is a big issue for the community. This is also the first open public meeting they've had.\n\nRegarding mental health, UCPD has stated they are in the midsts of hiring mobile mental health professionals to respond to crisis. They say once these professionals are hired, they will respond to calls instead of UCPD officers. This is referring to their SWIFT mental health advocates.\n\nAs an aside- One of the community concerns for this effort is that recently, the UC campuses mental health practitioners have reported that most UCs are unable to recruit qualified staff to work on these mobile crisis teams. Schools which have successfully implemented this are UCSC and UCSD,respectively. Without these mobile units operational, police intervention is the only response available for students in crisis. It should be noted that UCR's plans for a mobile mental health team have been ongoing for at least two years now. No clarification was given regarding what caused the multiple year delay for the program's launch.\n\nSecondly, an undergraduate student mentioned there was a police call placed on a group of striking union members during their efforts to liberate the Glascow dining hall. What this is in reference to is that during the Winter 2022 TA strike, a smaller group of union members demonstrated protest by physically blocking the exit and entry doors of dining halls across the UC system to allow students to walk in and out of the dining hall without needing to pay, hence the term \"liberation\". It was mentioned that UCR was the only UC campus to have the police called on them while performing this demonstration. Community members urged that this incident was documented through social media, so it did in fact, was witnessed by part of the campus community. UCR Admin initially stated to no clue what the student was referring to. However, once more folks mentioned the incident, they backpedaled and stated they knew of the call but emphasized they did not send police.  \n\nFact check wise, I personally remember witnessing the police block the streets leading to Glascow and intervening. Other community members reportedly also stated this as well during the meeting. So it's not clear why UCR admin and UCPD would say otherwise at the police accountability meeting...\n\nAnyway this is where the conversation about campus safety stands.", "id": "1360vlo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "created_utc": 1683062919.0, "score": 12, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "comments": ["Boyfriends catalytic converter was stolen twice right across the street and they didn\u2019t do anything.

The senate passed the motion and needed to be confirmed by either Judicial or the Elections Committee. The Elections Committee then met and voted in favor of a new election which is why candidates started to campaign again and Elections made the announcement on their Instagram. \n\nWe are now hearing that the Elections Committee felt pressured to vote and wanted to revote on having a new election. They redid their vote and are now retracting their original decision and if this stays there will NOT be a new election. \n\nThis will be discussed at tonight's senate meeting and any student is allowed to speak during public comment. The meeting is tonight at 7pm in the ASUCR Senate Chambers on the second floor of the HUB. \n\nPlease see the following threads if you need more context about what is going on: \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1357zoc/asucr\\_redoing\\_their\\_election/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1357zoc/asucr_redoing_their_election/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/130ad8j/asucr\\_meeting\\_426\\_summary/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/130ad8j/asucr_meeting_426_summary/)\n\nEDIT: You can also attend the meeting virtually via zoom \nhttps://ucr.zoom.us/j/94545626447", "id": "1374lej", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1374lej/asucr_new_election_decision_to_be_revoked/", "created_utc": 1683160204.0, "score": 10, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1374lej/asucr_new_election_decision_to_be_revoked/", "comments": ["ALRIGHT!

I wasn't at the meeting but I know a couple of folks who did attend so I made a report since policing is a big issue for the community. This is also the first open public meeting they've had.\n\nRegarding mental health, UCPD has stated they are in the midsts of hiring mobile mental health professionals to respond to crisis. They say once these professionals are hired, they will respond to calls instead of UCPD officers. This is referring to their SWIFT mental health advocates.\n\nAs an aside- One of the community concerns for this effort is that recently, the UC campuses mental health practitioners have reported that most UCs are unable to recruit qualified staff to work on these mobile crisis teams. Schools which have successfully implemented this are UCSC and UCSD,respectively. Without these mobile units operational, police intervention is the only response available for students in crisis. It should be noted that UCR's plans for a mobile mental health team have been ongoing for at least two years now. No clarification was given regarding what caused the multiple year delay for the program's launch.\n\nSecondly, an undergraduate student mentioned there was a police call placed on a group of striking union members during their efforts to liberate the Glascow dining hall. What this is in reference to is that during the Winter 2022 TA strike, a smaller group of union members demonstrated protest by physically blocking the exit and entry doors of dining halls across the UC system to allow students to walk in and out of the dining hall without needing to pay, hence the term \"liberation\". It was mentioned that UCR was the only UC campus to have the police called on them while performing this demonstration. Community members urged that this incident was documented through social media, so it did in fact, was witnessed by part of the campus community. UCR Admin initially stated to no clue what the student was referring to. However, once more folks mentioned the incident, they backpedaled and stated they knew of the call but emphasized they did not send police.  \n\nFact check wise, I personally remember witnessing the police block the streets leading to Glascow and intervening. Other community members reportedly also stated this as well during the meeting. So it's not clear why UCR admin and UCPD would say otherwise at the police accountability meeting...\n\nAnyway this is where the conversation about campus safety stands.", "id": "1360vlo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "created_utc": 1683062919.0, "score": 12, "permalink": "/r/ucr/comments/1360vlo/5123_ucpd_accountability_public_meeting_notes/", "comments": ["Boyfriends catalytic converter was stolen twice right across the street and they didn\u2019t do anything.
