Across species, subregions of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) are implicated in a variety of functions germane to pain, predictions, and learning. Human fMRI studies show that VMPFC activity tracks expectations about pain and mediates expectancy effects on pain-related activity in other brain regions. Prior lesion studies suggest that VMPFC may instead play a more general role in generating affective responses to painful stimuli. To test whether VMPFC is required to generate affective responses to pain or is more specifically involved in expectancy-based pain modulation, we studied responses to heat stimuli in five adults with bilateral surgical lesions of VMPFC and twenty healthy adults without brain damage. All participants underwent a quantitative sensory testing procedure followed by a pain expectancy task in which cues predicting either low or high pain were followed by intermittent medium intensity heat stimuli. Compared to adults without brain damage, individuals with VMPFC lesions reported larger differences in expected pain based on predictive cues and failed to update expectations following the covert introduction of unexpected medium temperature stimuli. Consistent with observed expectancy differences, subjective pain unpleasantness ratings in the VMPFC lesion group were more strongly modulated by cue during thermal stimulation. We found no group differences in overall pain sensitivity, nor in relationships between pain and autonomic arousal, suggesting that VMPFC damage specifically enhances the effect of expectations on pain processing, likely driven by impaired integration of new sensory feedback to update expectations about pain. These results provide essential new data regarding the specific functional contribution of VMPFC to pain modulation."], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "Masturbation originated about 40 million years ago within the primate order \u2014 an ancient trait associated with reproductive success in males, as yet more data on female masturbation required", "selftext": "", "id": "145nqyy", "url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjvvjx/jacking-off-has-evolutionary-benefits-going-back-40-million-years-study-says", "created_utc": 1686363025.0, "score": 26, "permalink": "/r/science/comments/145nqyy/masturbation_originated_about_40_million_years/", "comments": ["Welcome to r/science!

When faced with the same consequences, women and men were equally likely to take the same risks again.

What used to be a conversation about ambitious target setting now focuses increasingly on implementation and interventions to achieve these targets. This liminal transition from ambition to implementation is complex and presents deep ambiguities that are challenging for scientists to communicate and decision-makers to fathom. A critical question is whether we can believe that countries will deliver on the commitments they have made. By evaluating policy characteristics of countries\u2019 net-zero targets, we can assign the targets credibility ratings, then estimate how greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and temperature are differentiated by our confidence in the targets. When we consider the credibility of current climate pledges, our assessment shows that the world remains far from delivering a safe climate future.", "In order to miss you have to aim", "I want to notice it s less than the last time. The previous studies on this subject was about 3.2\u00b0C\nStill not enough but there is some progress", "Absolutely it can keep going especially if we do nothing till the environment is so toxic that most of us die. Then the emissions will stop and the world will reach a new equilibrium, without us. Over time all traces will disappear and we will be forgotten by reality.", "Of note is that their graph in the article closely matches [the graph they link to from Climate Action Tracker](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/), which is nice because (a) replication is good in science, and (b) that one's not paywalled.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the analysis in this paper is likely to be somewhat conservative due to two underlying assumptions:\n\n**First**, they project **current** policies of various types through the end of the century; however, examination of Climate Action Tracker's projections from [2018](https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/warming-projections-global-update-dec-2018/) vs. [2022](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/) shows that policies have had a tendency to get *significantly* more ambitious over time.  By projecting today's policies forward in time, they implicitly assume that process of improvement comes to a sudden stop.  \n\n**Second**, they project current **policies**; however, governmental policies are not the only driver of decarbonization.  Economics are a second major driver ([solar has been the cheapest electricity in history for several years now](https://www.carbonbrief.org/solar-is-now-cheapest-electricity-in-history-confirms-iea/)), and will arguably be a more impactful driver than policy in the next 10-20 years.\n\nBy contrast, major data-driven projections which do not make these assumptions tend to be more optimistic; for example, [the IEA projects an emissions peak around 2025](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/27/carbon-emissions-to-peak-in-2025-in-historic-turning-point-says-iea) and [an emissions reduction of around 15% by 2030](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/global-energy-related-co2-emissions-by-scenario-1990-2050).  This is still within the projection envelope of this paper, but near the bottom of it (it fairly closely matches the 2030 level of [SSP1-2.6 from IPCC WGI](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf) which results in 1.8C of warming by the end of the century).\n\nSo while this paper is a useful contribution in terms of categorizing and analysing current policies, like all papers it has limitations, notably the focus on \"current\" and \"policies\".", "The answer is obvious one no one wants to admit:  either reduce population by choice now or have even more population lost against our will later.", "Well I won't be alive anyway so screw it.", "In truth there have been a plethora of studies, each with their own criteria, and methodology.

There was pressure to dress conservatively in public, and act certain \"appropriate\" ways once you became an adult. That sentiment has eroded greatly.

The findings suggest that exposure to binge-levels of alcohol during adolescence, when the brain is still developing, lead to long-lasting changes in the brain\u2019s ability to signal and communicate \u2014 potentially setting the stage for long-term behavioral changes and hinting towards the mechanisms of alcohol-induced cognitive changes in humans.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here,\u201d said Nikki Crowley, assistant professor in biology and biomedical engineering and Huck Early Chair in Neurobiology and Neural Engineering, \u201cis that if adolescent binge drinking knocks neurons off this trajectory, they might not be able to get back, even if the alcohol consumption stops.\u201d\n\nThe prefrontal cortex is a key brain region for executive functioning, risk assessment and decision-making.

Disruptions to its development in young people may have serious and long-lasting consequences, added Crowley.\n\n\u201cHeavy binge drinking is problematic for everyone, and should be avoided, but adolescent brains appear to be particularly vulnerable to the consequences, which in humans, will follow them for decades,\u201d Crowley said.", "Don\u2019t give yourself wet brain folks", "Adolescence is way to young for a mouse to take up modeling.

The findings of this study demonstrate the influence that alcohol intake may have on risk of disease in populations around the world.\n\nThe researchers used data from the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB), a collaborative study of over 512,000 adults recruited during 2004-08 from ten diverse urban and rural areas across China.

About a third of men, but only 2% of women, drank alcohol regularly (ie at least once a week).

Importantly, they also undertook a genetic analysis to clarify whether or not alcohol intake was responsible for causing disease.\n\nKey findings:\n\n\u2022 Among 207 diseases studied, self-reported alcohol intake was associated with higher risks of 61 diseases in men.

Although nearly absent in most plants, taurine makes up as much as 0.1% of the body weight of animals. Humans synthesize taurine but depend on exogenous sources in early life when production is insufficient to support development, making it semi-essential. In species with very low synthesis, such as cats, taurine remains essential throughout adulthood; inadequate intake leads rapidly to retinal damage, immunological issues, and cardiomyopathy. In humans, small clinical trials of taurine supplementation in adults have suggested benefits in metabolic and inflammatory diseases. Yet, precisely what taurine does in most cases remains poorly understood. On page 1028 of this issue, Singh et al. (5) provide evidence that taurine maintains health in aged animal models.\n\nSingh et al. demonstrate that a decline in circulating taurine is a feature of aging in multiple species, including humans, with levels falling by \u223c80% over the human life span. They further found that mice lacking the major taurine transporter had shorter adult life spans. Supplementing taurine from middle age increased median life span by 10 to 23% in wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode worms) and 10 to 12% in wild-type mice. In mice, administering taurine was also associated with improvements in strength, coordination, and memory, as well as attenuation of multiple hallmarks of aging, including cellular senescence, mitochondrial and DNA damage, and chronic inflammation (\u201cinflammaging\u201d).

I wonder if cellular damage that impairs cellular function leads to a low energy state in the cell.

Even in aging where mTOR is a target. \n\nIt seems like a new 'cause' of a disease comes out weekly. Obviously there are not 27 causes of AD. There may be multiple ways to slow or stop the disease. Signal transduction pathways are cascades signal transducing proteins. The MEK kinase system has a series of three kinases MEK, MEKK, and MEKKK. The kinase cascade can be initiated by a receptor/ligand binding, at the other end the last kinase may activate a protein that regulates protein degradation. That is 5 targets for a single pathway. \n\nIt is easy to see why there are so many proposed causes. It is one pathway that has multiple molecularbtargets.\n\nBack to our friend beta amyloid. It comes from mis-processed precursor, APP. When APP is processed normally, the APP is clipped roughly in the middle of the beta amyloid segment. When it is mis-processed a protease clips APP in two alternative places to release the beta amyloid. Almost anything that stresses the neuron will cause an increase in beta amyloid. The beta amyloid forms these insoluble macromolecular structures, the characteristic AD plaques.\n\nTangles, the other pathological characteristic finding in AD has also been proposed as the cause of AD. Trisomy 21 and the Dutch mutation shifted the bullseye to beta amyloid over the tangle theory. There are many other amyloidosis diseases. Synuclein is deposited in Parkinson's. Transthyretin in FPA. All of these findings support a role for beta amyloid in AD. Calcium disregulation could be the critical second step in the pathology. Ca is known to play a role in neuronal cell death in stroke. One more brick on the load. Ca is sequestered in cell vesicles in an energy dependent process. Helping mitochondrial function will help increase energy level (ATP). Now the cell can sequester the Ca. So Ca will no longer activate say, cascades or PKC, alter cAMP and  cGMP levels. \n\nVDAC would fall into the Ca arena. It transports calcium.

Smoking alone causes diabetes by killing adipocytes, how else do you explain that other than membrane damage by foreign particles?", "> Membrane damage occurs in a lot of diseases. Did the membrane damage lead to the disease, or is membrane damage part of the disease process. Last do you get a death spiral where the disease cause membrane damage which in turn exacerbates the underlying disease which causes more membrane damage .......\n\nObviously it's the smoking and whatever risk factor that is the root cause, however membrane damage is the bottleneck or focal point where risk factors and disease features converge. I delved deep into atherosclerosis and I am certain that membrane damage is the cause (for lack of a better word), partly because [EPA but not DHA has been shown to improve atherosclerosis by stabilizing membranes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/tqi3g7/randomized_trials_show_fish_oil_reduces/). Trans fats are [remarkably resistent to oxidation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/bi034927y) so the LDL oxidation hypothesis is bunk, but once they are [incorporated into membranes they mimic membrane damage by increasing NF-\u03baB activation](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029600).\n\nI am not aware of any positive feedback loop in atherosclerosis, but I can think of two plausible ways this might happen: Increasing thickness of artery walls which makes them more prone to ischemia, or by making them vulnerable to pathogen invasion that requires NADPH oxidase to fight. I excluded oxidized LDL as a possible source of membrane damage, partly because trans fats do not oxidize, and partly because the liver rapidly takes up oxidized LDL via scavenger receptors. But I am all ears if you have a better idea of what could cause a feedback loop.\n\n\n> GUTs do not work except in a broad, general sense. Acid-base disregulation makes on susceptible to kidney stones, osteoporosis, and some types of arthritis. Similar models have been proposed for other disregulation.\n\nI think the membrane damage theory has sufficient basis as the unifying theory of chronic diseases, or at least a very strong explanatory element in disease models. Obviously it's not just the membrane damage, but all associated processes like membrane maintenance, lipoprotein circulation, and oxysterol/peroxylipid excretion.\n\n\n> Mitochondria seem to be involved in a lot of diseases. I wonder if cellular damage that impairs cellular function leads to a low energy state in the cell. Turning up mitochondrial function provides the cell with sufficient energy to repair itself and mitigate the effects of the damage. \n\nCells pad their membranes with cholesterol as prophylactic against damage, this cholesterol then interferes with mitochondrial function. https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/ajpheart.1982.242.2.H254, https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.215822, https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2014029117, https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article/117/4/e57/6104336?login=false\n\nI have seen some studies where better energy production leads to better cellular function, but I think what matters in chronic diseases is cholesterol availability and lipoprotein circulation. Ischemic cells might be able to generate energy via glycolysis, but they can not synthesize cholesterol and rely on external lipoproteins.\n\n\n> In just about every degenerative disease, mitochondrial function is implicated. Even in aging where mTOR is a target. \n\nChris Knobbe blames linoleic acid for making cardiolipin more vulnerable to lipid peroxidation, which would lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic diseases. I do not fully trust this theory yet, it is plausible but does not explain things as neatly as membrane damage, and is in fact only one instance of a more general membrane damage theory.\n\nAs for mTOR be aware that insulin and cellular overnutrition also activate mTOR, so it is plausible that the observed effects are due to these upstream pathways. For example insulin negatively affects vascular smooth muscle cells, and cellular overnutrition prevents LDL receptor expression, which creates a situation similar to familial hypercholesterolemia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR#Function, https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/52/10/2562/11025/Insulin-Affects-Vascular-Smooth-Muscle-Cell, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X17305132, Brown & Goldstein\n\n\n> It seems like a new 'cause' of a disease comes out weekly. Obviously there are not 27 causes of AD. There may be multiple ways to slow or stop the disease. Signal transduction pathways are cascades signal transducing proteins. The MEK kinase system has a series of three kinases MEK, MEKK, and MEKKK. The kinase cascade can be initiated by a receptor/ligand binding, at the other end the last kinase may activate a protein that regulates protein degradation. That is 5 targets for a single pathway. \n>\n> It is easy to see why there are so many proposed causes. It is one pathway that has multiple molecularbtargets.\n\nThis is why I like the membrane theory, it explains multiple risk factors and their interactions with each other. Membrane health is a weak point affected by many factors, and we only have a certain capacity to repair them. I am not that familiar with MAPK and secondary messenger systems, although I briefly investigated MAPK and JNK within the context of chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\n\n> Back to our friend beta amyloid. It comes from mis-processed precursor, APP. When APP is processed normally, the APP is clipped roughly in the middle of the beta amyloid segment. When it is mis-processed a protease clips APP in two alternative places to release the beta amyloid. Almost anything that stresses the neuron will cause an increase in beta amyloid. The beta amyloid forms these insoluble macromolecular structures, the characteristic AD plaques.\n\nI vaguely remember a decade ago reading something about cholesterol domains, and how they interfere with APP cleaving and give rise to amyloid beta. Can you confirm please whether this is truly the case, and can we integrate it with the previously mentioned prohpylactic cholesterol padding?\n\n\n> Tangles, the other pathological characteristic finding in AD has also been proposed as the cause of AD. Trisomy 21 and the Dutch mutation shifted the bullseye to beta amyloid over the tangle theory. There are many other amyloidosis diseases. Synuclein is deposited in Parkinson's. Transthyretin in FPA. All of these findings support a role for beta amyloid in AD. Calcium disregulation could be the critical second step in the pathology. Ca is known to play a role in neuronal cell death in stroke. One more brick on the load. Ca is sequestered in cell vesicles in an energy dependent process. Helping mitochondrial function will help increase energy level (ATP). Now the cell can sequester the Ca. So Ca will no longer activate say, cascades or PKC, alter cAMP and cGMP levels.\n\nBeta amyloid interventions spectacularly backfired though, there is only one medication approved amidst huge controversy. I am not keeping up with tau protein research, but last time I checked there were already two or three failed interventions. Alpha synuclein accumulation in Parkinson's disease was shown to be mainly due to lysosomal dysfunction, but I also remember some connections to mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nCalcium is a way too widely used substance, I investigated it but it is difficult to draw conclusions. Atherosclerotic calcification is the result of apoptosis, statins increase calcification because HMG-CoA reductase is responsible for suppressing apoptosis. It is possible neural death also comes from apoptosis, and calcification is just a side effect rather than the cause. But I would be glad to hear any information, because CFS also involves calcium dysregulation due to impaired ATP production. https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/qpp0s9/behavioral_characteristics_and_selfreported/hk4f4k4/, https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/ohmrls/hypothesis_predicts_major_failure_point_in/\n\n\n> VDAC would fall into the Ca arena. It transports calcium. Reducing free intracellular Ca should slow the Ca mediated cell toxicity. I will have to catch up on VDAC. I have not paid it much attention.\n\nI would investigate its effects on ROS, maybe VDAC1 is the missing piece that transports ATP and ROS from mitochondria into cytosol of ischemic cells.", "I suppose in the realm of pop-science.

Biomarker tests include specific types of PET scans and tests that measure amyloid and tau proteins in the fluid part of blood and cerebral spinal fluid.\"\n\nNotice how they dance around \"certain\" diagnosis? Why is that? Well, because AD is a disease of the brain, it has two main components that we can consider:\n\n1. Physiological changes to the brain - actual physical changes to cells and their surroundings\n2. Cognitive changes - changes to the person's behavior, cognition, etc.\n\nFor most of history, when a living patient came to a clinic, we were only really able to look at #2, the cognitive changes. People would come to the clinic with memory loss, changes to \"executive function\" (basic cognitive skills to plan tasks and achieve goals), confusion, apathy, depression, anxiety, etc., and they'd be given different neuropsychological exams, maybe some medications to mitigate symptoms. The doctor might decide they have \"dementia\" (an umbrella term for cognitive decline), and depending on the way their exams and symptoms panned out, they might get a probable diagnosis of AD, or some other dementia (i.e. dementia with Lewy bodies, a more Parkinsonian type of dementia, or frontotemporal dementia, a dementia that primarily affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain).\n\nWhy is it so difficult to get a 100% certain diagnosis? Well, that has to do with component #1 in our list above. While a patient may present to the clinic with symptoms that match a known dementia, we cannot confirm the disease until a pathologist is able to look at the brain under a microscope and identify ***which*** proteins are accumulating ***where*** in the patient's brain. As you can imagine, this is done post-mortem, so we cannot do this in living people (because you have to slice the brain up into hundreds of tissue sections on slides). The articles I linked allude to this notion of \"well, back in the day we couldn't diagnose AD with certainty, but now we have X Y Z technologies...\" and yes, we have better neuroimaging (brain scans like MRI, PET, etc.) and new biomarkers (we're developing ways of testing for these diseases using blood and cerebrospinal fluid), but we're still not at a 1:1 correlation between a patient's clinical presentation + tests and their final diagnosis/post-mortem pathological evaluation. We still frequently get cases in clinics that look very much like X disease, but when the patient passes away and the post-mortem analysis is done, we find all the pathological hallmarks (protein accumulation and changes to the tissue) specific to Y disease -- this is kind of what I linked in the previous comment you responded to. It's something we're still working on, and in fact, I'm personally working on such a project! But my boss is a neuropathologist and she likes to drive home the following point: as things stand now, you still NEED a medical doctor (pathologist) to examine the post-mortem tissue if you want a certain diagnosis of AD.\n\nFinally, I want to bring it to the main point, and the metaphorical \"pickle\" of that comment I made above - AD is a bit of a chicken-or-the-egg disease. The pathological hallmark of AD is the accumulation of both beta-amyloid proteins outside of neurons and tau proteins inside of neurons, called plaques and NFT (neurofibrillary tangles, not crypto pictures), respectively. When we look at a brain that has been heavily affected by AD, we find a lot of these plaques and NFTs all over the place, as well as shrinkage of brain areas (atrophy) and neuronal loss. We know that the accumulation of these proteins is not healthy for cells, and if you overexpress these proteins, you can force them to accumulate and kill neurons (that's how a lot of the \"mouse models\" of AD work), but we're not sure if that's what's driving AD-related changes to the brain or if it's something else that's causing plaques and NFTs, and we're just looking at the leftovers/consequences of a more invisible killer. So are we looking at the cause or the effect, the chicken or the egg? And people have a TON of theories about how this works, how the pathology \"spreads\" and such, but the fact of the matter is that while we have a lot of great paths for investigation, we're still not sure yet. And that's why I still have a job. I'm trying to figure it out :)\n\nHope that helps, and grateful that there are people outside of the field who are enthusiastic about what we do!", "Mice have most of the same genes as humans but it seems like they aren't all used in the same way.\n\nThere's a few human genetic mutations that are known to lead to specific cancers:  mutations in Rb lead to Retinablastoma in humans, mutations in BRCA1 lead to breast cancer in humans.\n\nIn mice, mutations in Rb lead to tumors in pituitary glands, mutations in BRCA1 lead to nothing.\n\nHere \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/nrc1235\nis a good summary.\n\n(I should say that maybe this is all 10-15 years out of date, so if things have improved someone who knows should chime in.)", "It would look worse.

For instance, lack of childhood nurturing, bullying, loneliness and social rejection.\n\nI am curious if the same regions of brains are involved in the more existential stresses of rodent life, compared to social stresses of human life? Rodents are extremely alert, from moment to moment, to avoid being attacked and eaten.  Destructive stresses of today's humans are likely to be long term emotional difficulties.

Appalled by that exorbitant cost, the authors of the analysis, which was published in BMC Medicine on 10 May, propose that journals should allow free-format submissions so researchers can spend their time and money on research instead.  \n>  \n>\u201cI cannot imagine why anyone would care what an article looks like the first time a journal sees it,\u201d says David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist at Arizona State University in Tempe, who was not involved with the study. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a productive use of my time.\u201d\n\nHere is the link to the peer-reviewed article: [https://doi.org/10.1186%2Fs12916-023-02882-y](https://doi.org/10.1186%2Fs12916-023-02882-y)", "But how else will journals assert their dominance if not by forcing scientists to use correct margins?", "The smoothest experience I've had has been with journals which allow TeX/LaTeX submissions. No time wasted in getting the formatting correct - just drop in their template and work out the few kinks still left\n\nIn some cases, the journal asked us to just submit the workspace and let them get the formatting right. Unfortunately, not that many journals do that, especially in biological/biomedical domains\n\n(Edit: Not to mention many supervisors/lab heads are apprehensive towards LaTeX due to the learning curve, the WYSIWYM approach and the lack of \"track changes\" and \"comments\")", "The whole science publishing industry seems like a massive scam of mostly make-work projects. Even more insane that they make scientists do the writing corrections, that\u2019s what they should have editors and technical writers for.", "In my experience the biggest pains are broader formatting guidelines regarding word count, figure size/design, etc shortly followed by explicitly requiring sections within the manuscript, followed very distantly by things like citation style, bureaucratic documents for submission, submission package order, file type, etc.\n\nMost journals accept common word processing software formats and just require an abstract, manuscript with references in a certain format, and figures/tables at the end. No real formatting changes aside from maybe changing a menu option in my citation manager. Then they do the work of formatting, typesetting, and arranging figures/tables within the text in the final PDF/print copy, which is non-trivial. You get a proof back to make requests for changes on and/or sign off on.\n\nWhat sucks is you don't always write a paper with a single target journal in mind, if you do it frequently changes due to changing directions or rejections, and in many cases a paper otherwise suited for a journal is just too long after heavy editing or (smfh) has \"too many references\" to be published in the same form.", "Maybe....\n\nJust maybe....\n\nWe don't need these parasite journals anymore", "OMG so much this.

The text and figure are in a simple format. Journals should be doing all of the work after that for formatting.

A big problem is when some journals merge merge Results and Discussions and Conclusions.  Since these are the major parts of the article having a combined Results and discussion section versus those sections being separate can lead to a lot of headaches rewriting and revising the document especially when a word count is added in.  I\u2019ve spent months sometimes revising and resubmitting papers.  Then if you get reviewers that ask for something that I literally had no resources to perform.

At least not in the few offline editors I have used. There is Overleaf though, an online editor that allows comments, track changes/version control and collaboration\n\nI think what gets LaTeX shot down fast is the learning curve. You don't necessarily type what you want to see, rather you program bits of your manuscript to render into what you meant\n\nAs an example, if I want to write a heading in Word, I'd type the heading and select it as a Heading in the ribbon. Word will automatically adjust the sizing and font to the current default for the heading type, and also take care of the outline. In LaTeX, I'd write out the heading as,\n\n ```\n\\section{Title}\nThis is the first section.\n```\n\nThen I can add a sub heading as,\n\n```\n\\subsection{Title 2}\nThis is the sub section\n```\n\nSo it's a bit like programming chunks of your document. Which is then processed into the final form. The benefit is that publishers and journals can design their own templates which customise how these programmatic chunks are processed to fit their style, thereby letting you focus on the content rather than the styling\n\n(This link gives small examples of the \"code\" at the beginning as well as the resultant document: https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Sections_and_chapters )\n\n(Edit: I haven't encountered a journal that asked for tracked changes in the same document during revision; my experience so far has been formal response letters with a list of changes as separate documents alongside the revised manuscript)", "I use latexdiff, it generates a file with highlighed changes, based on the original submission file and the revised one.", "Using Git with LaTeX is the best way to do that IMO", "If you use LyX, a GUI for LaTeX, that does the track changes for you.

Compared to trimming 100+ citations without leaving unsupported points, or removing thousands of words without reducing the impact or losing the narrative is much worse.

This is because these morons have no clue about how hard it is to do a really good and productive research, and so they cannot consider it as a justification for publishing. For this reason, they need you to meet the criteria that they can understand.\n\nAlso, there is an unwritten rule, according which the shittier the school is, the more it enforces formalities as requirements to earn degrees.

But, regardless of whether it\u2019s major suppliers trying to recoup after a seizure or it\u2019s street sellers trying to make ends meet during a drought, the problem is that after the police do the right thing and remove illegal drugs from neighborhoods, people start dying more. My first thought was what another commenter said, street drugs aren\u2019t reliable recipes. So long as the fda doesn\u2019t regulate it, it doesn\u2019t get regulated. Remember, the death rate goes up, not from zero, just up. I can pretty much guarantee that under normal circumstances autopsies aren\u2019t done on drug overdoses to determine if it was too much of a good recipe that killed them or it was some garbage that would have killed anybody. Point is, most addicts know their limits. I would assume most over doses were bad batches. As an example, back in 99 they had to pull RedBulls off the shelves because the ephedrine in it was mixing with the heroin mixed in mdma pills and causing overdoses in teenagers at raves. Likewise, there was always the danger of ecstasy pills that used both speed and opiates which would cause heart attacks. I took one pill once. It made me itch. I took a Benadryl and spent the next three hours vomiting to the raging colors and music in my head while floating in and out of consciousness. I almost died but was too messed up to ask to go to the hospital and my friends just left me in the grass because I just looked sleepy. An od is probably not usually an od so much as it is a bad mixture, which is what this article makes me feel. Take all the drugs off the streets, overdoses go up. Overdosing on what? Doesn\u2019t make sense unless you think about how quickly new \u2018stock\u2019 shows up; rushed, or faked. I\u2019m still for legalization in order to regulate under medical care, but as far as this situation goes, the only thing I can think of is community notice of seizures to warn users that the police have seized the usual drugs and do not trust what fills the void, kinda like handing out condoms and clean needles.  Honestly, I got one more suggestion but I think it\u2019s illegal so don\u2019t do it. But, if drug dealers were organized then when a seizure occurs in one area, surplus from another area can fill the void with the safe stuff. Sounds horrible but, at least it\u2019s consistent for the users. Reality is, the marijuanna transition is working, prohibition was ironed out, people are even figuring out that that third cup of coffee in the morning makes you afternoon sleepy. See, here\u2019s the real issue. It\u2019s not the drug that the gov seems to be fighting, it\u2019s how addictive they each are. Meth and heroin are horribly addictive (and intense.) So, it\u2019s about regulating drugs without losing the functionality of the person. That\u2019s why lsd is illegal. Not because it opens up your third eye. But because the trip lasts eight hours. If it was legal it would be so easy to just sit around and dose all day. And, that\u2019s why you never hear about cocaine. Not because of some Cuban conspiracy, but because people who do coke tend to hold jobs so there\u2019s no societal suffering. Just keep it quiet and no one knows. Same with prescription pills. That\u2019s why it took so long to get weed legalized, people had to prove that society will still function if it\u2019s legalized. To be honest, I bet pharma could put the drug trade out of business with morphine and pure cocaine to supplant the dirtier addictions but gov is gonna have to work in mental health evaluations in to their uses. But, at least they\u2019d be clean, regulated versions. I once got a bottle of morphine. 30 10mg time release pills. Woke up at nine, bought a mountain at seven eleven to take it, then made jewelry at the beach for ten hours. 30 days straight. No complications, no cravings. Still, some people won\u2019t be able to regulate themselves. Me, five 20 oz Red Bulls a day if I could. But the point is, this is a hard one to see clearly because it\u2019s not about addictions (else we\u2019d be discussing all drugs, not just street drugs.) it\u2019s about a particular \u2019substitution\u2019 of a removed drug. So, this is not a psychology question. It\u2019s a procedural one.

I'm sure opiates can kill you directly as well, but from what I understand, the main thing that kills people is the indirect effects such as throwing up and then choking in your sleep, or just straight up forgetting to breath.

The RC (research chem) market is booming n offers infinite tweaks to existing opioids like fentanyl. The newer they are, the cheaper they are, and in my experience, the stronger they are.

Hallucinations don't seem to be an issue when you're giving good prompts, though.\n\nIn the next few years, I would not be surprised to see universities rolling out super computers whose only purpose is to run generative AI models that must be prompted and in ways that are data safe such as to protect the university and its researchers.", "I'll await replication before I get too excited.Not that it will be relevant in 6 months either way.\n\nIt also seems like an odd thing to focus your efforts.

They invariably start by emphasizing the significance of wireless networks and their projected importance in the future. Such repetitious preambles, while clear and perhaps redundant, are still somehow expected by reviewers due to ingrained conventions of academic writing.*\n\n*For authors for whom English is not a first language, AI like GPT could potentially provide valuable assistance in revising parts of their papers to ensure they meet standards of formal readability.*\n\nPretty good, I would say.", "One depressing aspect of science writing is essentially cultural.\n\nIn theory as long as you fully describe your methods accurately and clearly your actual writing style shouldn't matter.\n\nBut in reality papers will be rejected if they're not written in a distinctive academic style that is largely a cultural shibboleth.  This mostly impacts non-english speakers but also anyone not from a long science background regardless of whether their actual methodology is fine.\n\nAnd yes, it's only a fraction of the work. You spend 6 months running numbers, doing analysis etc and then you have to actually write up the paper. \n\nOften, if that paper was being written as a blog post, you could provide all the detailed info that another researcher would need quite easily, but for journals it's demanded in a literary style that apes the early 20th century British upper class.\n\nTL;DR A big fraction of the most dysfunctional things about science revolve around publishers and publishing.\n\nBeing able to dump a bunch of information, statements and descriptions of methods into a box and ask for them in a style suitable for a research paper that you can then check over to make sure it's not mangled anything is valuable.", "I agree that humans still need to do the majority of the work, but the ability for the models to save time is unreal. \n\nFor example, some figures in our lab take humans hours to make.

Lipid rafts are key elements in synaptic plasticity, and their modification with aging alters interactions and distribution of signaling molecules, such as glutamate receptors and ion channels involved in memory formation, eventually leading to cognitive decline. In the present study, we have analyzed, in vivo, the effects of dietary supplementation of n-3 LCPUFA on the lipid structure, membrane microviscosity, domain organization, and partitioning of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors in hippocampal lipid raffs in female mice. The results revealed several lipid signatures of \u201clipid rafts aging\u201d in old mice fed control diets, consisting in depletion of n-3 LCPUFA, membrane unsaturation, along with increased levels of saturates, plasmalogens, and sterol esters, as well as altered lipid relevant indexes. These changes were paralleled by increased microviscosity and changes in the raft/non-raft (R/NR) distribution of AMPA-R and mGluR5. Administration of the n-3 LCPUFA diet caused the partial reversion of fatty acid alterations found in aged mice and returned membrane microviscosity to values found in young animals. Paralleling these findings, lipid rafts accumulated mGluR5, NMDA-R, and ASIC2, and increased their R/NR proportions, which collectively indicate changes in synaptic plasticity. Unexpectedly, this diet also modified the lipidome and dimension of lipid rafts, as well as the domain redistribution of glutamate receptors and acid-sensing ion channels involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, likely modulating functionality of lipid rafts in memory formation and reluctance to age-associated cognitive decline."], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "70% of Food, Drinks Within Arm\u2019s Reach Are Unhealthy.

The division of labor creates specialized behavioral groups within an animal society which are sometimes referred to as 'castes'. Eusociality is distinguished from all other social systems because individuals of at least one caste usually lose the ability to perform at least one behavior characteristic of individuals in another caste. Eusocial colonies can be viewed as superorganisms.\n\n(Since I expect someone will ask, the Wikipedia article goes on to mention that some researchers have argued that humans are weakly eusocial, but that this is a contentious view. So consider eusociality more in the context of e.g. bees, ants, etc., as with the termites discussed in this research.)\n\nSo the title on its own suggests that this alarm behaviour (\u201cethology\u201d) predates their highly organized colonies and specializations. Reading the abstract, it seems they determined this by looking at alarm signalling behaviour across a number of related species, and inferred that the vibration signalling happened with a common ancestor to the species studied here. The abstract refers to the vibration signalling as an \u201cethological synapomorphy\u201d. \u201cEthological\u201d refers to the study of animal behaviour, and \u201csynapomorphy\u201d to an evolved trait, specifically one evolved by a most recent common ancestor. (A synapomorphy is a special case of an [_apomorphy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apomorphy_and_synapomorphy), an evolved trait not held by an ancestor species. A synapomorphy is shared, implying its development by that most recent common ancestor I already mentioned.)\n\nTL;DR: termites evolved this vibration-signalling behaviour before they were even the species of termites we recognize today.

This study documented changes in the prevalence of pack characteristics among the top-selling cigarette products in the US in 2018 and 2021.\r  \n\r  \nMethods\r  \nThe 50 cigarette packs with the highest national unit sales in US convenience stores in 2018 and 2021 were identified using Nielsen's Scantrack data and subsequently purchased. Packs were coded for features such as dominant color(s), descriptive text, and promotional language. Descriptive analyses conducted in 2022 weighted by total annual unit sales compared the prevalence of pack characteristics between years.\r  \n\r  \nResults\r  \nThree brands \u2013 Marlboro, Newport, and Camel \u2013 constituted over 80% of pack sales among the top-selling products. Packs with red as a dominant color grew less popular between years (33.3% vs. 29.5%), while green became more prevalent (25.2% vs. 28.9%), consistent with a rise in the proportion of menthol sales. Prevalence of descriptors such as \u201cflavor\u201d and \u201cfresh\u201d decreased from 46.0% to 39.4% and 9.7% to 5.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, prevalence of promotional language (e.g., rewards programs) increased from 60.9% to 69.0%.\r  \n\r  \nConclusions\r  \nThe use of visual and named colors remains common, which can implicitly communicate sensory or health-related attributes. Moreover, promotions may help recruit and retain consumers in the context of more restrictive tobacco control policies and price increases. Given the strong influence that cigarette packaging exerts on consumers, packaging-focused policies \u2013 such as plain packaging laws \u2013 may reduce appeal and accelerate declines in cigarette use.", "Right?

We used a representative survey of 3,510 people living in five US states (Colorado, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, and Texas) conducted in 2022. Individuals provided information on past experiences with firearms, perceptions of threat and neighborhood safety, discrimination, and tolerance of uncertainty alongside demographic items. The analysis was conducted in November 2022. Past experiences with firearms and prior victimization are associated with increased firearm ownership and carrying practices. Threat sensitivity is associated with owning more guns while poorer perceptions of neighborhood safety correspond with owning fewer guns but greater risk for unsafe storage practices like storing a loaded gun in a closet or drawer. Intolerance of uncertainty is associated with owning fewer guns and lower risk for carrying outside of the home but greater risk for unsafe storage. Prior experience of discrimination is associated with risk for carrying firearms outside of the home. Demographic characteristics related to sex, rurality, military service, and political conservatism predict risky firearm-related behaviors related to firearm ownership, carrying frequency, and unsecure storage. Taken together, we find firearm ownership and risky firearm behaviors (e.g. carrying, unsafe storage) are more prominent among groups such as politically conservative males living in rural areas while also being influenced by threatening experiences, uncertainty, and perceptions of safety.", "Would they classify previous sexual assault/rape as any of these categories ?", "They paid to study that?

But crocodilians and one species of turtle have a special kind of temperature dependent sex determination (TSD) in which males are produced at intermediate temperatures. For example, in the population of snapping turtles I worked on, more males differentiate at (constant) temperatures between 22 and 28 and more females are produced at thermal extremes. But in nature you wouldn\u2019t encounter constant temperatures, so in most situations you get a mix of sexes and frequently embryos that couldn\u2019t decide on one sex and have intersex gonads (at least morphologically). You can think of it as a dosage - if you get a hit of a female-producing temperature you start going in that direction, a male-producing temperature will pull you in the other direction. At the end of the temperature-sensitive window, your sex outcome depends on all the temperatures you experienced.\n\nOh, and it gets more complicated than that too - because your sex is also influenced by genetics (some parents have more female or more male babies on average), oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the nest, moisture conditions\u2026 even the mother\u2019s age can influence their offspring\u2019s sex. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been shying away from using \u2018temperature dependent sex determination\u2019 specifically, these all exist on a spectrum of genetically-influenced environmental sex determination. \n\nNow in sea turtles which are probably the best studied, hotter temperatures produce females. We\u2019re seeing issues now where beach temperatures are so hot, it\u2019s feminizing all the babies. One green sea turtle study found > 99% females in nests, and this was like 10 years ago.\n\nFor your second question, if you\u2019re getting at the evolutionary reasons for environmental sex determination, you\u2019re on the right track. It is believed that environmental sex determination is ancient in vertebrates, dinosaurs maybe even had it, and it\u2019s present in lots of fishes. We now believe that this phenomenon persisted through evolution because it matches sex to fitness.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re a fish (like sea bass or flatfish, which have TSD) and you\u2019re a big fish, you\u2019re probably going to be more fit if you\u2019re a female (you have the potential to make more eggs). Now coincidentally, the temperatures that lead to faster growth and bigger fish are also the temperatures that make females in this species. In contrast, middling egg temperatures generally make bigger snapper babies. In this species, males are usually bigger and have to fight for territory and mating. So it\u2019s advantageous for a male to be produced at those good temperatures that lead to better growth and bigger adults. \n\nEndothermy probably has something to do with a loss of environmental sex determination on an evolutionary scale. Why maintain this system across evolutionary time if embryonic temperatures don\u2019t have large effects on your adult life? But even then it\u2019s not complete. Some birds have a degree of environmental sex determination despite mostly being endothermic and also having distinct sex chromosomes. Some turtles (eg soft shells) have \u2018homomorphic sex chromosomes\u2019 (they pass down a sex chromosome, but they don\u2019t look different like X or Y), and actually don\u2019t have strong environmental sex determination. \n\nWe don\u2019t know why this happens specifically, but there are probably either reasons that selection maintained environmental sex determination (advantages to individual fitness) or selection wasn\u2019t really happening (not strong enough advantages or disadvantages, so they were lost in noise) or maybe genetic sex determination had some population advantages (like balanced sex ratios). Or maybe it\u2019s totes random - stochastic maintenance of systems.

These landscapes are characterized by differences in socioeconomic context, habitat suitability and patch connectedness. Identifying which spatial differences enable outbreaks of pests, pathogens and invasive species will improve targeted control efforts.We tested hypotheses to explain the distribution and demography of puncturevine Tribulus terrestris, a human-dispersed invasive plant in Boise, a city in the western United States. We hypothesized an increase in puncturevine infestations near low-valued properties with a high proportion of bare ground, the species' preferred microhabitat, that are well connected on the urban road network. To test these hypotheses, we collected data on the abundance, emergence and persistence of reproductive plants in transects spanning >100 km of our study city. We then used hierarchical Bayesian models to evaluate the impacts of spatial covariates on puncturevine distribution and demography.Bare ground cover consistently increased abundance, emergence and persistence of puncturevine, indicating the overarching importance of suitable establishment sites for this invasive species.Property value had the strongest impact on puncturevine abundance and was the most important main effect in the model for puncturevine emergence. In both models, lower-valued properties had a higher risk of puncturevine occurrence.The effects of road network connectivity depended on bare ground cover, with the highest predicted abundance and emergence of puncturevine in patches with low connectivity on the road network and high bare ground cover. Understanding these relationships will require data that can disentangle seed dispersal from establishment limitations.Identifying characteristics of urban patches that promote outbreaks of harmful species will improve the effectiveness and equity of control efforts. The prevalence of puncturevine in lower-valued properties is cause for concern as the plant impedes bicycle transportation, with the potential for disproportionate impacts on marginalized groups that lack resources to repair punctured tires. Our results add to a growing recognition that low-connectivity street networks have undesirable outcomes for environmental sustainability.

Now in 2023 its more common to have water temps average at 29 Celsius and sometimes hit 30 Celsius underwater!\n\n\nIt's a crazy big increase in temperature, and causes this thing called coral bleaching, that's when coral colonies get stressed and purge the symbiotic algae they depend on for making food as a response.

And as I'm sure most of you will have heard we have been having record breaking heat waves here in Southeast Asia year after year.\n\nWhile bleached corals are not immediately dead and some can recover if the water temperature goes back down, This also greatly weakens the surviving corals, and makes them very susceptible to other diseases. \n\nIn other words: the increase in coral disease is a symptom, not the cause. The biggest cause is actually climate change.\n\nNot saying that trash and water pollution aren't problems, because they are, but they aren't doing as much damage as people think they are compared to the increase in water temperatures. Water pollution leads to algal blooms which suffocates patches of coral, but the reef has a response to that at least.

I begin by reviewing extant research on PTG, with a focus on measurement and conceptual issues.  \n>  \n>Expanding on arguments made by others, I distinguish between three forms of PTG, 1) perceived PTG, which is an individual's beliefs about their own PTG, 2) genuine PTG, which is veridical growth following adversity, and 3) illusory PTG, which is motivated fabrications of PTG.  \n>  \n>**Perceived PTG is extremely common, as over half of individuals exposed to a potentially traumatic event (PTE) report moderate or greater levels of PTG. I review evidence that most self-reports of PTG are greatly exaggerated and argue that perceived PTG is mostly illusory PTG.**  \n>  \n>**I propose five reasons for the disconnect between perceived PTG and genuine PTG, including design flaws in the current measurements, emotional biases that favor perceived PTG, the inherent appeal of PTG, cultural expectations, and problems of definition.**  \n>  \n>**I then review the empirical evidence concerning the prevalence rate of genuine PTG, coming to the bold conclusion that the occurrence of genuine PTG is very rare, contradicting current fundamental beliefs about PTG.**  \n>  \n>I recommend researchers focus on the key areas of measurement and etiology of genuine PTG, which are necessary to create interventions that foster genuine PTG. I conclude by outlining a path to steer the scientific progression of PTG back in the right direction.\n\nAuthor: Professor Adriel Boals, Director of Behavioral Science Program at the University of North Texas.", "If I'm understanding this right: \n\nWhat doesn't kill you, does not, in fact, make you stronger, your suffering does not actually build character, and most everyone flunks out of the school of hard knocks.", "As someone suffering CPTSD, I would say a huge driver of illusory PTG is cultural/social pressure. People do not want to believe suffering is for nothing, and simultaneously want to disbelieve that they need to take any action to help alleviate the social ills that worsen, perpetuate, and cause trauma (i.e. poverty, social ostracism, homelessness, income inequality, etc). After all, if trauma just makes a person stronger, is it so bad? Why should anyone burden themselves emotionally or expend energy trying to engage with solutions or in comforting us when they believe that, ultimately, our suffering is 'worth it'. They demand that we perform this improvement and assuage their negative feelings surrounding our suffering. 8 of 10 people will respond to admissions of trauma by saying: 'but it made you stronger, right?' No! It has made my life extremely, exceedingly difficult, in fact.\n\nBut that social pressure is strong, and many of us want to believe this 'trauma is good for growth' narrative, because we also do not want our suffering to be for naught. Many traumatized folks delay/deny/avoid treatment due to this fallacy so in the long-run our collective denial is hurting us. We want to be accepted so we carry the water for this cultural concept. Many deny themselves help or understanding by papering over our wounds with heart warming platitudes.\n\nThis attitude is rampant in US society. They want us to make them feel good/okay about life/society and insist that we value our damage as some sort of opportunity for growth. It is galling and harmful. Unless we are ex-military, our suffering is not seen as honorable or acceptable. When I struggle, I am called a downer and alienate people. My emotional dysregulation scares people and makes them think I am an essentially bad person to be around; that I am dangerous. Further, many struggle to accept that behavior is wired into our nervous system and that I am not simply choosing to be 'dramatic', 'self-absorbed', or 'negative'.\n\nPlease, I am begging you, listen and empathize with us and stop pressuring us into performing 'redemption' narratives ready made for an Oprah interview.", "this is really dark and sad and not at all what i needed to read tonight", "Also - maybe there is PTG but that is from the place of trauma i.e. the baseline gets knocked lower and people grow significantly from the new baseline, but not above where they were before it.", "Antifragility isn\u2019t easy, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s still not worth pursuing imo.

There is indeed a medical condition with a definition that is caused by trauma. Anything that causes PTSD or CPTSD is trauma. There is no need to confuse this issue with some ontological discussion of what a word means to people, or how people are impacted differently by similar events. That is not at issue.", "I think this is still discounting something.\n\nLike in your example, even if it's not proper forgiveness, if you believe you've forgiven them and now you don't hold the regret, anger, or whatever emotion plagued you before the forgiveness, aren't you still growing in that case?", "[removed]", "It is a thing in personality disorders but more generally it's pretty common behavior in survival situations.

The victim may eventually understand what's going on clearly enough (this part is growth). They might start doing what the abuser does in other similar situations, so that they now win those situations too (though not necessarily against the same abuser). The reason for that could be as simple as \"this is a method that I've seen work, now I know how to use it too\", rather than something that requires a psychiatric label.\n\nThey may (rightly or wrongly) see that as growth for themselves, in that they have overcome their perceived difficulties in such situations. They may not see (or not want to see) the detriment in it, e.g. harming or pushing away the people they do this to. Or downplay such detriment, reasoning that they've overcome it themselves, so it's minor.\n\nThey may not look for other ways of handling the situation that don't involve such abusive behavior, thinking they've grown enough.

Your statement is so vague, and plays to many logical fallacies, as well as stereotypes and prejudices that it might as well be on a poster in a guidance counselors office about ableism.\n\nUltimately, you just have to take our word for it. Our struggles never EXCUSE bad behavior, but can provide context to help with forgiveness and understanding; and in helping to communicate better moving forward. Anyone who is asking you to totally excuse their harmful behavior, without taking responsibility and striving to make improvements, is doing a poor job of life and their social responsibilities, and should not be excused--whether they are traumatized or not. There is a difference between a contrite person who is being vulnerable and taking responsibility vs someone who just deflects, rejects responsibility, or otherwise tries to evade accountability.

Adaptations are needed if the species wants to survive the next 10,000 years for sure. And I don\u2019t mean force changes and try and half ass filling plot holes. We will lose every time. A reset may be its only plausible outcome for survival.

In essence, it's a demonstration of the argument that language isn't just downstream of behavior (a result or reflection of behavior), but can also be upstream of behavior (a cause or influencer of behavior).", "Order yourself a trophy!"], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "Indian, Korean researchers develop light-powered supercapacitors", "selftext": "", "id": "145w32j", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/indian-korean-researchers-develop-light-powered-supercapacitors/article66950924.ece", "created_utc": 1686390676.0, "score": 2, "permalink": "/r/science/comments/145w32j/indian_korean_researchers_develop_lightpowered/", "comments": ["Welcome to r/science!

Here, we couple data on diversity in the sequence of the genome with voice and vowel acoustics in speech recordings from 12,901 Icelanders. We show how voice pitch and vowel acoustics vary across the life span and correlate with anthropometric, physiological, and cognitive traits. We found that voice pitch and vowel acoustics have a heritable component and discovered correlated common variants in ABCC9 that associate with voice pitch. The ABCC9 variants also associate with adrenal gene expression and cardiovascular traits.

This has lead to a lot more cross-generational commonality in interests.\n\nI do think this is part of it. The older people now are old enough to remember when video games were \"kid\" things. But then, there was historically a ton of cross generational interest in sports, at least for men.  I wonder if they are just so old that they never had the \"kid stuff\" mentality (especially as I don't understand most sports to have started as appealing to kids, but trickling down to them after adults played.  Though, really, amateur sports leagues that adults casually play in don't seem to happen as much anymore, either, but that could just be my own selection bias speaking.\n\n>Better sports science and fitness (among non-overweight folks) really leads to a lot more shared interest in physical activities as well. I, and many of my 40-something friends, still regularly play basketball and still feel very comfortable playing with younger 20-30 year old \"kids.\"\n\nMy 40-something parents played volleyball with the 20-somethings 25 years ago.  But they did slow down a lot in their late 40s and 50s.  Though part of that is that the 20-somethings were their kids and friends kids - and those kids finished school, got jobs, got married, etc. and stopped spending as much time with them and with fewer and older people, they were less inclined to play.  Plus my parents got broadband internet (well, DSL, but we thought we were flying then) and so that became my dad's primary entertainment, especially.\n\n>At the end of the day, I think there was just a perception that we would eventually become more like our parents as we got older, and the fact that never really happened is really interesting.\n\nThis is true, but I actually wonder if our parents (well, my generations') have something to do with it.  Boomers were such a big market segment and dominated a lot of media for a long time, so there's definitely cross-generation interest there. Particularly in regards to music (both technology and the customer base meant oldies stations, the hit songs used in movies 20 years later, etc.). There hasn't been the same kind of generational divide in subsequent generations.\n\nBut yeah, we still play video games, many of us adults watch at least some cartoons not targeting adults, we take vitamins that taste like gummi bears, etc.  And, too, since even before the Boomers reached adulthood, we've increasingly become more casual in clothing so that nowadays the difference in how teenagers and adults dress isn't so stark as it once was.", "We have pictures and they look old to me now even though I\u2019m the age they were now.

The findings suggest that exposure to binge-levels of alcohol during adolescence, when the brain is still developing, lead to long-lasting changes in the brain\u2019s ability to signal and communicate \u2014 potentially setting the stage for long-term behavioral changes and hinting towards the mechanisms of alcohol-induced cognitive changes in humans.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here,\u201d said Nikki Crowley, assistant professor in biology and biomedical engineering and Huck Early Chair in Neurobiology and Neural Engineering, \u201cis that if adolescent binge drinking knocks neurons off this trajectory, they might not be able to get back, even if the alcohol consumption stops.\u201d\n\nThe prefrontal cortex is a key brain region for executive functioning, risk assessment and decision-making.

Although nearly absent in most plants, taurine makes up as much as 0.1% of the body weight of animals. Humans synthesize taurine but depend on exogenous sources in early life when production is insufficient to support development, making it semi-essential. In species with very low synthesis, such as cats, taurine remains essential throughout adulthood; inadequate intake leads rapidly to retinal damage, immunological issues, and cardiomyopathy. In humans, small clinical trials of taurine supplementation in adults have suggested benefits in metabolic and inflammatory diseases. Yet, precisely what taurine does in most cases remains poorly understood. On page 1028 of this issue, Singh et al. (5) provide evidence that taurine maintains health in aged animal models.\n\nSingh et al. demonstrate that a decline in circulating taurine is a feature of aging in multiple species, including humans, with levels falling by \u223c80% over the human life span.

Supplementing taurine from middle age increased median life span by 10 to 23% in wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode worms) and 10 to 12% in wild-type mice. In mice, administering taurine was also associated with improvements in strength, coordination, and memory, as well as attenuation of multiple hallmarks of aging, including cellular senescence, mitochondrial and DNA damage, and chronic inflammation (\u201cinflammaging\u201d).

Tobacco contains compounds that physically harms membranes, and microplastics were also shown to do the same. Diabetes involves cellular overnutrition which interferes with cellular function, and it prevents cells from taking up lipoproteins to repair membranes. Cholesterol synthesis is an oxygen intensive process, so ischemic cells rely on external lipoproteins to repair their membranes.\n\nHeart disease occurs because cells in the artery wall get damaged by foreign particles, hypertension, and ischemia, and they can not take up enough LDL particles to repair membranes. See familial hypercholesterolemia where LDL receptors are dysfunctional, their heart disease risk skyrockets the more metabolically unhealthy they are.

ApoE4 sucks at transporting lipids between neurons and glia, so again their risk of damage skyrockets in the presence of other risk factors.\n\nA study shows that post-heart attack ischemia elevates serum beta amyloid to 3-70 (!) times its normal value, which makes it very clear that ischemia or membrane damage is responsible for beta amyloid production. Likewise VDAC1 not only transports ATP but also regulates mitochondrial ROS production, so overexpression might produce excess ROS that damages membranes. As far as I know ischemia causes mitochondrial ROS to spill out into the cytosol, which sounds suspiciously similar to what VDAC1 is doing with ATP.

Even in aging where mTOR is a target. \n\nIt seems like a new 'cause' of a disease comes out weekly. Obviously there are not 27 causes of AD. There may be multiple ways to slow or stop the disease. Signal transduction pathways are cascades signal transducing proteins. The MEK kinase system has a series of three kinases MEK, MEKK, and MEKKK. The kinase cascade can be initiated by a receptor/ligand binding, at the other end the last kinase may activate a protein that regulates protein degradation. That is 5 targets for a single pathway. \n\nIt is easy to see why there are so many proposed causes. It is one pathway that has multiple molecularbtargets.\n\nBack to our friend beta amyloid. It comes from mis-processed precursor, APP. When APP is processed normally, the APP is clipped roughly in the middle of the beta amyloid segment. When it is mis-processed a protease clips APP in two alternative places to release the beta amyloid. Almost anything that stresses the neuron will cause an increase in beta amyloid. The beta amyloid forms these insoluble macromolecular structures, the characteristic AD plaques.\n\nTangles, the other pathological characteristic finding in AD has also been proposed as the cause of AD. Trisomy 21 and the Dutch mutation shifted the bullseye to beta amyloid over the tangle theory. There are many other amyloidosis diseases. Synuclein is deposited in Parkinson's. Transthyretin in FPA. All of these findings support a role for beta amyloid in AD. Calcium disregulation could be the critical second step in the pathology. Ca is known to play a role in neuronal cell death in stroke. One more brick on the load. Ca is sequestered in cell vesicles in an energy dependent process. Helping mitochondrial function will help increase energy level (ATP). Now the cell can sequester the Ca. So Ca will no longer activate say, cascades or PKC, alter cAMP and  cGMP levels. \n\nVDAC would fall into the Ca arena. It transports calcium.

Last do you get a death spiral where the disease cause membrane damage which in turn exacerbates the underlying disease which causes more membrane damage .......\n\nObviously it's the smoking and whatever risk factor that is the root cause, however membrane damage is the bottleneck or focal point where risk factors and disease features converge. I delved deep into atherosclerosis and I am certain that membrane damage is the cause (for lack of a better word), partly because [EPA but not DHA has been shown to improve atherosclerosis by stabilizing membranes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/tqi3g7/randomized_trials_show_fish_oil_reduces/). Trans fats are [remarkably resistent to oxidation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/bi034927y) so the LDL oxidation hypothesis is bunk, but once they are [incorporated into membranes they mimic membrane damage by increasing NF-\u03baB activation](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029600).\n\nI am not aware of any positive feedback loop in atherosclerosis, but I can think of two plausible ways this might happen: Increasing thickness of artery walls which makes them more prone to ischemia, or by making them vulnerable to pathogen invasion that requires NADPH oxidase to fight. I excluded oxidized LDL as a possible source of membrane damage, partly because trans fats do not oxidize, and partly because the liver rapidly takes up oxidized LDL via scavenger receptors. But I am all ears if you have a better idea of what could cause a feedback loop.\n\n\n> GUTs do not work except in a broad, general sense. Acid-base disregulation makes on susceptible to kidney stones, osteoporosis, and some types of arthritis. Similar models have been proposed for other disregulation.\n\nI think the membrane damage theory has sufficient basis as the unifying theory of chronic diseases, or at least a very strong explanatory element in disease models. Obviously it's not just the membrane damage, but all associated processes like membrane maintenance, lipoprotein circulation, and oxysterol/peroxylipid excretion.\n\n\n> Mitochondria seem to be involved in a lot of diseases. I wonder if cellular damage that impairs cellular function leads to a low energy state in the cell. Turning up mitochondrial function provides the cell with sufficient energy to repair itself and mitigate the effects of the damage. \n\nCells pad their membranes with cholesterol as prophylactic against damage, this cholesterol then interferes with mitochondrial function. https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/ajpheart.1982.242.2.H254, https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.215822, https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2014029117, https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article/117/4/e57/6104336?login=false\n\nI have seen some studies where better energy production leads to better cellular function, but I think what matters in chronic diseases is cholesterol availability and lipoprotein circulation. Ischemic cells might be able to generate energy via glycolysis, but they can not synthesize cholesterol and rely on external lipoproteins.\n\n\n> In just about every degenerative disease, mitochondrial function is implicated. Even in aging where mTOR is a target. \n\nChris Knobbe blames linoleic acid for making cardiolipin more vulnerable to lipid peroxidation, which would lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic diseases. I do not fully trust this theory yet, it is plausible but does not explain things as neatly as membrane damage, and is in fact only one instance of a more general membrane damage theory.\n\nAs for mTOR be aware that insulin and cellular overnutrition also activate mTOR, so it is plausible that the observed effects are due to these upstream pathways. For example insulin negatively affects vascular smooth muscle cells, and cellular overnutrition prevents LDL receptor expression, which creates a situation similar to familial hypercholesterolemia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR#Function, https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/52/10/2562/11025/Insulin-Affects-Vascular-Smooth-Muscle-Cell, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X17305132, Brown & Goldstein\n\n\n> It seems like a new 'cause' of a disease comes out weekly.

The kinase cascade can be initiated by a receptor/ligand binding, at the other end the last kinase may activate a protein that regulates protein degradation. That is 5 targets for a single pathway. \n>\n> It is easy to see why there are so many proposed causes. It is one pathway that has multiple molecularbtargets.\n\nThis is why I like the membrane theory, it explains multiple risk factors and their interactions with each other. Membrane health is a weak point affected by many factors, and we only have a certain capacity to repair them. I am not that familiar with MAPK and secondary messenger systems, although I briefly investigated MAPK and JNK within the context of chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\n\n> Back to our friend beta amyloid. It comes from mis-processed precursor, APP. When APP is processed normally, the APP is clipped roughly in the middle of the beta amyloid segment. When it is mis-processed a protease clips APP in two alternative places to release the beta amyloid. Almost anything that stresses the neuron will cause an increase in beta amyloid. The beta amyloid forms these insoluble macromolecular structures, the characteristic AD plaques.\n\nI vaguely remember a decade ago reading something about cholesterol domains, and how they interfere with APP cleaving and give rise to amyloid beta. Can you confirm please whether this is truly the case, and can we integrate it with the previously mentioned prohpylactic cholesterol padding?\n\n\n> Tangles, the other pathological characteristic finding in AD has also been proposed as the cause of AD. Trisomy 21 and the Dutch mutation shifted the bullseye to beta amyloid over the tangle theory. There are many other amyloidosis diseases. Synuclein is deposited in Parkinson's. Transthyretin in FPA. All of these findings support a role for beta amyloid in AD. Calcium disregulation could be the critical second step in the pathology. Ca is known to play a role in neuronal cell death in stroke. One more brick on the load. Ca is sequestered in cell vesicles in an energy dependent process. Helping mitochondrial function will help increase energy level (ATP). Now the cell can sequester the Ca. So Ca will no longer activate say, cascades or PKC, alter cAMP and cGMP levels.\n\nBeta amyloid interventions spectacularly backfired though, there is only one medication approved amidst huge controversy. I am not keeping up with tau protein research, but last time I checked there were already two or three failed interventions. Alpha synuclein accumulation in Parkinson's disease was shown to be mainly due to lysosomal dysfunction, but I also remember some connections to mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nCalcium is a way too widely used substance, I investigated it but it is difficult to draw conclusions. Atherosclerotic calcification is the result of apoptosis, statins increase calcification because HMG-CoA reductase is responsible for suppressing apoptosis. It is possible neural death also comes from apoptosis, and calcification is just a side effect rather than the cause. But I would be glad to hear any information, because CFS also involves calcium dysregulation due to impaired ATP production. https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/qpp0s9/behavioral_characteristics_and_selfreported/hk4f4k4/, https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/ohmrls/hypothesis_predicts_major_failure_point_in/\n\n\n> VDAC would fall into the Ca arena. It transports calcium. Reducing free intracellular Ca should slow the Ca mediated cell toxicity. I will have to catch up on VDAC. I have not paid it much attention.\n\nI would investigate its effects on ROS, maybe VDAC1 is the missing piece that transports ATP and ROS from mitochondria into cytosol of ischemic cells.", "There is in fact a statue to their contribution in science.

We're used to talking about illnesses (like COVID-19!) where you can run a test and get a confirming diagnosis, right? But that's not quite the case for AD. Let's consider a few excerpts from:\n\n* [The NIH](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/how-alzheimers-disease-diagnosed): \n   * \"Before the early 2000s, the only sure way to know whether a person had Alzheimer\u2019s disease was through autopsy, a procedure that is performed after death. Thanks to advances in research, lab and imaging tests are now available to help a doctor or researcher see biological signs of the disease, or biomarkers, in a living person.\"\n* [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350453):\n   * \"In the past, Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed for certain only after death when looking at the brain with a microscope revealed plaques and tangles. Health care providers and researchers are now able to diagnose Alzheimer's disease during life with more certainty. Biomarkers can detect the presence of plaques and tangles. Biomarker tests include specific types of PET scans and tests that measure amyloid and tau proteins in the fluid part of blood and cerebral spinal fluid.\"\n\nNotice how they dance around \"certain\" diagnosis? Why is that? Well, because AD is a disease of the brain, it has two main components that we can consider:\n\n1. Physiological changes to the brain - actual physical changes to cells and their surroundings\n2. Cognitive changes - changes to the person's behavior, cognition, etc.\n\nFor most of history, when a living patient came to a clinic, we were only really able to look at #2, the cognitive changes. People would come to the clinic with memory loss, changes to \"executive function\" (basic cognitive skills to plan tasks and achieve goals), confusion, apathy, depression, anxiety, etc., and they'd be given different neuropsychological exams, maybe some medications to mitigate symptoms. The doctor might decide they have \"dementia\" (an umbrella term for cognitive decline), and depending on the way their exams and symptoms panned out, they might get a probable diagnosis of AD, or some other dementia (i.e. dementia with Lewy bodies, a more Parkinsonian type of dementia, or frontotemporal dementia, a dementia that primarily affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain).\n\nWhy is it so difficult to get a 100% certain diagnosis? Well, that has to do with component #1 in our list above. While a patient may present to the clinic with symptoms that match a known dementia, we cannot confirm the disease until a pathologist is able to look at the brain under a microscope and identify ***which*** proteins are accumulating ***where*** in the patient's brain. As you can imagine, this is done post-mortem, so we cannot do this in living people (because you have to slice the brain up into hundreds of tissue sections on slides). The articles I linked allude to this notion of \"well, back in the day we couldn't diagnose AD with certainty, but now we have X Y Z technologies...\" and yes, we have better neuroimaging (brain scans like MRI, PET, etc.) and new biomarkers (we're developing ways of testing for these diseases using blood and cerebrospinal fluid), but we're still not at a 1:1 correlation between a patient's clinical presentation + tests and their final diagnosis/post-mortem pathological evaluation. We still frequently get cases in clinics that look very much like X disease, but when the patient passes away and the post-mortem analysis is done, we find all the pathological hallmarks (protein accumulation and changes to the tissue) specific to Y disease -- this is kind of what I linked in the previous comment you responded to. It's something we're still working on, and in fact, I'm personally working on such a project! But my boss is a neuropathologist and she likes to drive home the following point: as things stand now, you still NEED a medical doctor (pathologist) to examine the post-mortem tissue if you want a certain diagnosis of AD.\n\nFinally, I want to bring it to the main point, and the metaphorical \"pickle\" of that comment I made above - AD is a bit of a chicken-or-the-egg disease. The pathological hallmark of AD is the accumulation of both beta-amyloid proteins outside of neurons and tau proteins inside of neurons, called plaques and NFT (neurofibrillary tangles, not crypto pictures), respectively. When we look at a brain that has been heavily affected by AD, we find a lot of these plaques and NFTs all over the place, as well as shrinkage of brain areas (atrophy) and neuronal loss. We know that the accumulation of these proteins is not healthy for cells, and if you overexpress these proteins, you can force them to accumulate and kill neurons (that's how a lot of the \"mouse models\" of AD work), but we're not sure if that's what's driving AD-related changes to the brain or if it's something else that's causing plaques and NFTs, and we're just looking at the leftovers/consequences of a more invisible killer. So are we looking at the cause or the effect, the chicken or the egg? And people have a TON of theories about how this works, how the pathology \"spreads\" and such, but the fact of the matter is that while we have a lot of great paths for investigation, we're still not sure yet. And that's why I still have a job. I'm trying to figure it out :)\n\nHope that helps, and grateful that there are people outside of the field who are enthusiastic about what we do!", "Mice have most of the same genes as humans but it seems like they aren't all used in the same way.\n\nThere's a few human genetic mutations that are known to lead to specific cancers:  mutations in Rb lead to Retinablastoma in humans, mutations in BRCA1 lead to breast cancer in humans.\n\nIn mice, mutations in Rb lead to tumors in pituitary glands, mutations in BRCA1 lead to nothing.\n\nHere \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/nrc1235\nis a good summary.\n\n(I should say that maybe this is all 10-15 years out of date, so if things have improved someone who knows should chime in.)", "It would look worse.

It is purely heterosexual women being weird about heterosexual male sexuality, and they should get a grip.\n\nMen *can* adjust their behavior if they're really, really striking out and feel like it's worth it.

My first thought was what another commenter said, street drugs aren\u2019t reliable recipes. So long as the fda doesn\u2019t regulate it, it doesn\u2019t get regulated. Remember, the death rate goes up, not from zero, just up. I can pretty much guarantee that under normal circumstances autopsies aren\u2019t done on drug overdoses to determine if it was too much of a good recipe that killed them or it was some garbage that would have killed anybody. Point is, most addicts know their limits. I would assume most over doses were bad batches. As an example, back in 99 they had to pull RedBulls off the shelves because the ephedrine in it was mixing with the heroin mixed in mdma pills and causing overdoses in teenagers at raves. Likewise, there was always the danger of ecstasy pills that used both speed and opiates which would cause heart attacks. I took one pill once. It made me itch. I took a Benadryl and spent the next three hours vomiting to the raging colors and music in my head while floating in and out of consciousness. I almost died but was too messed up to ask to go to the hospital and my friends just left me in the grass because I just looked sleepy. An od is probably not usually an od so much as it is a bad mixture, which is what this article makes me feel. Take all the drugs off the streets, overdoses go up. Overdosing on what? Doesn\u2019t make sense unless you think about how quickly new \u2018stock\u2019 shows up; rushed, or faked. I\u2019m still for legalization in order to regulate under medical care, but as far as this situation goes, the only thing I can think of is community notice of seizures to warn users that the police have seized the usual drugs and do not trust what fills the void, kinda like handing out condoms and clean needles.  Honestly, I got one more suggestion but I think it\u2019s illegal so don\u2019t do it. But, if drug dealers were organized then when a seizure occurs in one area, surplus from another area can fill the void with the safe stuff. Sounds horrible but, at least it\u2019s consistent for the users. Reality is, the marijuanna transition is working, prohibition was ironed out, people are even figuring out that that third cup of coffee in the morning makes you afternoon sleepy. See, here\u2019s the real issue. It\u2019s not the drug that the gov seems to be fighting, it\u2019s how addictive they each are. Meth and heroin are horribly addictive (and intense.) So, it\u2019s about regulating drugs without losing the functionality of the person. That\u2019s why lsd is illegal. Not because it opens up your third eye. But because the trip lasts eight hours. If it was legal it would be so easy to just sit around and dose all day. And, that\u2019s why you never hear about cocaine. Not because of some Cuban conspiracy, but because people who do coke tend to hold jobs so there\u2019s no societal suffering. Just keep it quiet and no one knows. Same with prescription pills. That\u2019s why it took so long to get weed legalized, people had to prove that society will still function if it\u2019s legalized. To be honest, I bet pharma could put the drug trade out of business with morphine and pure cocaine to supplant the dirtier addictions but gov is gonna have to work in mental health evaluations in to their uses. But, at least they\u2019d be clean, regulated versions. I once got a bottle of morphine. 30 10mg time release pills. Woke up at nine, bought a mountain at seven eleven to take it, then made jewelry at the beach for ten hours. 30 days straight. No complications, no cravings. Still, some people won\u2019t be able to regulate themselves. Me, five 20 oz Red Bulls a day if I could. But the point is, this is a hard one to see clearly because it\u2019s not about addictions (else we\u2019d be discussing all drugs, not just street drugs.) it\u2019s about a particular \u2019substitution\u2019 of a removed drug. So, this is not a psychology question. It\u2019s a procedural one. And, I don\u2019t know how this stuff works, let alone how it should work.", ">There is a tremendously judgemental \"they got what they deserved\" attitude that is unlikely to disappear any time soon.\n\nThis is exactly my thought when I heard one of the largest fentanyl importer busts turned out to be the head of the San Jose Police Union doing the importing.\n\nI guarantee you she was fine with people using the product dying because they \"deserved\"  it.", "Which is a great explanation of why decriminalization seems important.

Lipid rafts are key elements in synaptic plasticity, and their modification with aging alters interactions and distribution of signaling molecules, such as glutamate receptors and ion channels involved in memory formation, eventually leading to cognitive decline. In the present study, we have analyzed, in vivo, the effects of dietary supplementation of n-3 LCPUFA on the lipid structure, membrane microviscosity, domain organization, and partitioning of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors in hippocampal lipid raffs in female mice. The results revealed several lipid signatures of \u201clipid rafts aging\u201d in old mice fed control diets, consisting in depletion of n-3 LCPUFA, membrane unsaturation, along with increased levels of saturates, plasmalogens, and sterol esters, as well as altered lipid relevant indexes. These changes were paralleled by increased microviscosity and changes in the raft/non-raft (R/NR) distribution of AMPA-R and mGluR5. Administration of the n-3 LCPUFA diet caused the partial reversion of fatty acid alterations found in aged mice and returned membrane microviscosity to values found in young animals. Paralleling these findings, lipid rafts accumulated mGluR5, NMDA-R, and ASIC2, and increased their R/NR proportions, which collectively indicate changes in synaptic plasticity. Unexpectedly, this diet also modified the lipidome and dimension of lipid rafts, as well as the domain redistribution of glutamate receptors and acid-sensing ion channels involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, likely modulating functionality of lipid rafts in memory formation and reluctance to age-associated cognitive decline."], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "70% of Food, Drinks Within Arm\u2019s Reach Are Unhealthy.

The division of labor creates specialized behavioral groups within an animal society which are sometimes referred to as 'castes'. Eusociality is distinguished from all other social systems because individuals of at least one caste usually lose the ability to perform at least one behavior characteristic of individuals in another caste. Eusocial colonies can be viewed as superorganisms.\n\n(Since I expect someone will ask, the Wikipedia article goes on to mention that some researchers have argued that humans are weakly eusocial, but that this is a contentious view. So consider eusociality more in the context of e.g. bees, ants, etc., as with the termites discussed in this research.)\n\nSo the title on its own suggests that this alarm behaviour (\u201cethology\u201d) predates their highly organized colonies and specializations. Reading the abstract, it seems they determined this by looking at alarm signalling behaviour across a number of related species, and inferred that the vibration signalling happened with a common ancestor to the species studied here. The abstract refers to the vibration signalling as an \u201cethological synapomorphy\u201d. \u201cEthological\u201d refers to the study of animal behaviour, and \u201csynapomorphy\u201d to an evolved trait, specifically one evolved by a most recent common ancestor. (A synapomorphy is a special case of an [_apomorphy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apomorphy_and_synapomorphy), an evolved trait not held by an ancestor species. A synapomorphy is shared, implying its development by that most recent common ancestor I already mentioned.)\n\nTL;DR: termites evolved this vibration-signalling behaviour before they were even the species of termites we recognize today.

This study documented changes in the prevalence of pack characteristics among the top-selling cigarette products in the US in 2018 and 2021.\r  \n\r  \nMethods\r  \nThe 50 cigarette packs with the highest national unit sales in US convenience stores in 2018 and 2021 were identified using Nielsen's Scantrack data and subsequently purchased. Packs were coded for features such as dominant color(s), descriptive text, and promotional language. Descriptive analyses conducted in 2022 weighted by total annual unit sales compared the prevalence of pack characteristics between years.\r  \n\r  \nResults\r  \nThree brands \u2013 Marlboro, Newport, and Camel \u2013 constituted over 80% of pack sales among the top-selling products. Packs with red as a dominant color grew less popular between years (33.3% vs. 29.5%), while green became more prevalent (25.2% vs. 28.9%), consistent with a rise in the proportion of menthol sales. Prevalence of descriptors such as \u201cflavor\u201d and \u201cfresh\u201d decreased from 46.0% to 39.4% and 9.7% to 5.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, prevalence of promotional language (e.g., rewards programs) increased from 60.9% to 69.0%.\r  \n\r  \nConclusions\r  \nThe use of visual and named colors remains common, which can implicitly communicate sensory or health-related attributes. Moreover, promotions may help recruit and retain consumers in the context of more restrictive tobacco control policies and price increases. Given the strong influence that cigarette packaging exerts on consumers, packaging-focused policies \u2013 such as plain packaging laws \u2013 may reduce appeal and accelerate declines in cigarette use.", "Right?

The analysis was conducted in November 2022. Past experiences with firearms and prior victimization are associated with increased firearm ownership and carrying practices. Threat sensitivity is associated with owning more guns while poorer perceptions of neighborhood safety correspond with owning fewer guns but greater risk for unsafe storage practices like storing a loaded gun in a closet or drawer. Intolerance of uncertainty is associated with owning fewer guns and lower risk for carrying outside of the home but greater risk for unsafe storage. Prior experience of discrimination is associated with risk for carrying firearms outside of the home.

But crocodilians and one species of turtle have a special kind of temperature dependent sex determination (TSD) in which males are produced at intermediate temperatures. For example, in the population of snapping turtles I worked on, more males differentiate at (constant) temperatures between 22 and 28 and more females are produced at thermal extremes. But in nature you wouldn\u2019t encounter constant temperatures, so in most situations you get a mix of sexes and frequently embryos that couldn\u2019t decide on one sex and have intersex gonads (at least morphologically). You can think of it as a dosage - if you get a hit of a female-producing temperature you start going in that direction, a male-producing temperature will pull you in the other direction. At the end of the temperature-sensitive window, your sex outcome depends on all the temperatures you experienced.\n\nOh, and it gets more complicated than that too - because your sex is also influenced by genetics (some parents have more female or more male babies on average), oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the nest, moisture conditions\u2026 even the mother\u2019s age can influence their offspring\u2019s sex. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been shying away from using \u2018temperature dependent sex determination\u2019 specifically, these all exist on a spectrum of genetically-influenced environmental sex determination. \n\nNow in sea turtles which are probably the best studied, hotter temperatures produce females. We\u2019re seeing issues now where beach temperatures are so hot, it\u2019s feminizing all the babies. One green sea turtle study found > 99% females in nests, and this was like 10 years ago.\n\nFor your second question, if you\u2019re getting at the evolutionary reasons for environmental sex determination, you\u2019re on the right track. It is believed that environmental sex determination is ancient in vertebrates, dinosaurs maybe even had it, and it\u2019s present in lots of fishes. We now believe that this phenomenon persisted through evolution because it matches sex to fitness.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re a fish (like sea bass or flatfish, which have TSD) and you\u2019re a big fish, you\u2019re probably going to be more fit if you\u2019re a female (you have the potential to make more eggs). Now coincidentally, the temperatures that lead to faster growth and bigger fish are also the temperatures that make females in this species. In contrast, middling egg temperatures generally make bigger snapper babies. In this species, males are usually bigger and have to fight for territory and mating. So it\u2019s advantageous for a male to be produced at those good temperatures that lead to better growth and bigger adults. \n\nEndothermy probably has something to do with a loss of environmental sex determination on an evolutionary scale. Why maintain this system across evolutionary time if embryonic temperatures don\u2019t have large effects on your adult life? But even then it\u2019s not complete. Some birds have a degree of environmental sex determination despite mostly being endothermic and also having distinct sex chromosomes. Some turtles (eg soft shells) have \u2018homomorphic sex chromosomes\u2019 (they pass down a sex chromosome, but they don\u2019t look different like X or Y), and actually don\u2019t have strong environmental sex determination. \n\nWe don\u2019t know why this happens specifically, but there are probably either reasons that selection maintained environmental sex determination (advantages to individual fitness) or selection wasn\u2019t really happening (not strong enough advantages or disadvantages, so they were lost in noise) or maybe genetic sex determination had some population advantages (like balanced sex ratios). Or maybe it\u2019s totes random - stochastic maintenance of systems.

These landscapes are characterized by differences in socioeconomic context, habitat suitability and patch connectedness. Identifying which spatial differences enable outbreaks of pests, pathogens and invasive species will improve targeted control efforts.We tested hypotheses to explain the distribution and demography of puncturevine Tribulus terrestris, a human-dispersed invasive plant in Boise, a city in the western United States. We hypothesized an increase in puncturevine infestations near low-valued properties with a high proportion of bare ground, the species' preferred microhabitat, that are well connected on the urban road network. To test these hypotheses, we collected data on the abundance, emergence and persistence of reproductive plants in transects spanning >100 km of our study city. We then used hierarchical Bayesian models to evaluate the impacts of spatial covariates on puncturevine distribution and demography.Bare ground cover consistently increased abundance, emergence and persistence of puncturevine, indicating the overarching importance of suitable establishment sites for this invasive species.Property value had the strongest impact on puncturevine abundance and was the most important main effect in the model for puncturevine emergence. In both models, lower-valued properties had a higher risk of puncturevine occurrence.The effects of road network connectivity depended on bare ground cover, with the highest predicted abundance and emergence of puncturevine in patches with low connectivity on the road network and high bare ground cover. Understanding these relationships will require data that can disentangle seed dispersal from establishment limitations.Identifying characteristics of urban patches that promote outbreaks of harmful species will improve the effectiveness and equity of control efforts. The prevalence of puncturevine in lower-valued properties is cause for concern as the plant impedes bicycle transportation, with the potential for disproportionate impacts on marginalized groups that lack resources to repair punctured tires. Our results add to a growing recognition that low-connectivity street networks have undesirable outcomes for environmental sustainability.

Been doing this for almost ten years now. In that ten years I've seen so much change in our local reefs it's heartbreaking.\n\n\nThe thing that has really been doing the most damage here is the steady increase in water temperatures. When I first started in 2013, it was common to record water temps around 26 Celsius. Now in 2023 its more common to have water temps average at 29 Celsius and sometimes hit 30 Celsius underwater!\n\n\nIt's a crazy big increase in temperature, and causes this thing called coral bleaching, that's when coral colonies get stressed and purge the symbiotic algae they depend on for making food as a response. That's why they turn white instead of being colourful. And as I'm sure most of you will have heard we have been having record breaking heat waves here in Southeast Asia year after year.\n\nWhile bleached corals are not immediately dead and some can recover if the water temperature goes back down, This also greatly weakens the surviving corals, and makes them very susceptible to other diseases. \n\nIn other words: the increase in coral disease is a symptom, not the cause. The biggest cause is actually climate change.\n\nNot saying that trash and water pollution aren't problems, because they are, but they aren't doing as much damage as people think they are compared to the increase in water temperatures. Water pollution leads to algal blooms which suffocates patches of coral, but the reef has a response to that at least. Sea urchin populations usually boom when that happens and feed on the algae, giving the corals a fighting chance.\n\nBut the heat it's widespread, coast to coast...

I begin by reviewing extant research on PTG, with a focus on measurement and conceptual issues.  \n>  \n>Expanding on arguments made by others, I distinguish between three forms of PTG, 1) perceived PTG, which is an individual's beliefs about their own PTG, 2) genuine PTG, which is veridical growth following adversity, and 3) illusory PTG, which is motivated fabrications of PTG.  \n>  \n>**Perceived PTG is extremely common, as over half of individuals exposed to a potentially traumatic event (PTE) report moderate or greater levels of PTG. I review evidence that most self-reports of PTG are greatly exaggerated and argue that perceived PTG is mostly illusory PTG.**  \n>  \n>**I propose five reasons for the disconnect between perceived PTG and genuine PTG, including design flaws in the current measurements, emotional biases that favor perceived PTG, the inherent appeal of PTG, cultural expectations, and problems of definition.**  \n>  \n>**I then review the empirical evidence concerning the prevalence rate of genuine PTG, coming to the bold conclusion that the occurrence of genuine PTG is very rare, contradicting current fundamental beliefs about PTG.**  \n>  \n>I recommend researchers focus on the key areas of measurement and etiology of genuine PTG, which are necessary to create interventions that foster genuine PTG. I conclude by outlining a path to steer the scientific progression of PTG back in the right direction.\n\nAuthor: Professor Adriel Boals, Director of Behavioral Science Program at the University of North Texas.", "If I'm understanding this right: \n\nWhat doesn't kill you, does not, in fact, make you stronger, your suffering does not actually build character, and most everyone flunks out of the school of hard knocks.", "As someone suffering CPTSD, I would say a huge driver of illusory PTG is cultural/social pressure. People do not want to believe suffering is for nothing, and simultaneously want to disbelieve that they need to take any action to help alleviate the social ills that worsen, perpetuate, and cause trauma (i.e. poverty, social ostracism, homelessness, income inequality, etc). After all, if trauma just makes a person stronger, is it so bad? Why should anyone burden themselves emotionally or expend energy trying to engage with solutions or in comforting us when they believe that, ultimately, our suffering is 'worth it'. They demand that we perform this improvement and assuage their negative feelings surrounding our suffering. 8 of 10 people will respond to admissions of trauma by saying: 'but it made you stronger, right?' No! It has made my life extremely, exceedingly difficult, in fact.\n\nBut that social pressure is strong, and many of us want to believe this 'trauma is good for growth' narrative, because we also do not want our suffering to be for naught. Many traumatized folks delay/deny/avoid treatment due to this fallacy so in the long-run our collective denial is hurting us. We want to be accepted so we carry the water for this cultural concept. Many deny themselves help or understanding by papering over our wounds with heart warming platitudes.\n\nThis attitude is rampant in US society. They want us to make them feel good/okay about life/society and insist that we value our damage as some sort of opportunity for growth. It is galling and harmful. Unless we are ex-military, our suffering is not seen as honorable or acceptable. When I struggle, I am called a downer and alienate people. My emotional dysregulation scares people and makes them think I am an essentially bad person to be around; that I am dangerous. Further, many struggle to accept that behavior is wired into our nervous system and that I am not simply choosing to be 'dramatic', 'self-absorbed', or 'negative'.\n\nPlease, I am begging you, listen and empathize with us and stop pressuring us into performing 'redemption' narratives ready made for an Oprah interview.", "this is really dark and sad and not at all what i needed to read tonight", "Also - maybe there is PTG but that is from the place of trauma i.e. the baseline gets knocked lower and people grow significantly from the new baseline, but not above where they were before it.", "Antifragility isn\u2019t easy, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s still not worth pursuing imo.

There is indeed a medical condition with a definition that is caused by trauma. Anything that causes PTSD or CPTSD is trauma. There is no need to confuse this issue with some ontological discussion of what a word means to people, or how people are impacted differently by similar events. That is not at issue.", "I think this is still discounting something.\n\nLike in your example, even if it's not proper forgiveness, if you believe you've forgiven them and now you don't hold the regret, anger, or whatever emotion plagued you before the forgiveness, aren't you still growing in that case?", "[removed]", "It is a thing in personality disorders but more generally it's pretty common behavior in survival situations.

The victim may eventually understand what's going on clearly enough (this part is growth). They might start doing what the abuser does in other similar situations, so that they now win those situations too (though not necessarily against the same abuser). The reason for that could be as simple as \"this is a method that I've seen work, now I know how to use it too\", rather than something that requires a psychiatric label.\n\nThey may (rightly or wrongly) see that as growth for themselves, in that they have overcome their perceived difficulties in such situations. They may not see (or not want to see) the detriment in it, e.g. harming or pushing away the people they do this to. Or downplay such detriment, reasoning that they've overcome it themselves, so it's minor.\n\nThey may not look for other ways of handling the situation that don't involve such abusive behavior, thinking they've grown enough.

Your statement is so vague, and plays to many logical fallacies, as well as stereotypes and prejudices that it might as well be on a poster in a guidance counselors office about ableism.\n\nUltimately, you just have to take our word for it. Our struggles never EXCUSE bad behavior, but can provide context to help with forgiveness and understanding; and in helping to communicate better moving forward. Anyone who is asking you to totally excuse their harmful behavior, without taking responsibility and striving to make improvements, is doing a poor job of life and their social responsibilities, and should not be excused--whether they are traumatized or not.

But with team sports, you have to answer to the rest of the team so if you suck, and are a clear liability to the team, you know it and it's generally not enjoyable. Even if you don't get made fun of for your lack of physical abilities, you can see people's eyes roll and sigh as you're put on the field, or the excessive time you've spent on the bench.

PE on the other hand in my experience is a double-edged sword. It fosters the self-esteem of those with average or above self-esteem through confirmation while to those with lower self-esteem it's just a regular reminder that they are not good enough. Surely this negative impact can be reduced by a capable PE teacher, but out of about 6 in my school time only 1 would fit that bill.

Here, we couple data on diversity in the sequence of the genome with voice and vowel acoustics in speech recordings from 12,901 Icelanders. We show how voice pitch and vowel acoustics vary across the life span and correlate with anthropometric, physiological, and cognitive traits. We found that voice pitch and vowel acoustics have a heritable component and discovered correlated common variants in ABCC9 that associate with voice pitch. The ABCC9 variants also associate with adrenal gene expression and cardiovascular traits.

Across species, subregions of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) are implicated in a variety of functions germane to pain, predictions, and learning. Human fMRI studies show that VMPFC activity tracks expectations about pain and mediates expectancy effects on pain-related activity in other brain regions. Prior lesion studies suggest that VMPFC may instead play a more general role in generating affective responses to painful stimuli. To test whether VMPFC is required to generate affective responses to pain or is more specifically involved in expectancy-based pain modulation, we studied responses to heat stimuli in five adults with bilateral surgical lesions of VMPFC and twenty healthy adults without brain damage. All participants underwent a quantitative sensory testing procedure followed by a pain expectancy task in which cues predicting either low or high pain were followed by intermittent medium intensity heat stimuli. Compared to adults without brain damage, individuals with VMPFC lesions reported larger differences in expected pain based on predictive cues and failed to update expectations following the covert introduction of unexpected medium temperature stimuli. Consistent with observed expectancy differences, subjective pain unpleasantness ratings in the VMPFC lesion group were more strongly modulated by cue during thermal stimulation. We found no group differences in overall pain sensitivity, nor in relationships between pain and autonomic arousal, suggesting that VMPFC damage specifically enhances the effect of expectations on pain processing, likely driven by impaired integration of new sensory feedback to update expectations about pain.

In a non ergodic system there are barriers that prevent that from happening.  Most real life scenarios (economically and psychologically) are non ergodic, even though most of the analysis that occurs with economic theory for example implicitly or explicitly assumes the system is ergodic. \n\nAs an example if you evaluated a game of Russian Roulette with a 6 chamber gun where the prize was $6000 for surviving, then the expected value assuming ergodic systems is $5000 so it would appear that you should play.  But the system is not ergodic, because if you lose, you cannot continue.  So the real expected value of the game is zero over time and it should be clear that despite the one time high payoff, the risk of ruin changes the actual payoff.  \n\nFrom that you could hypothesize that the female of our species has evolved with a better ability to understand and react to the non ergodic nature of dynamic systems.

What used to be a conversation about ambitious target setting now focuses increasingly on implementation and interventions to achieve these targets. This liminal transition from ambition to implementation is complex and presents deep ambiguities that are challenging for scientists to communicate and decision-makers to fathom. A critical question is whether we can believe that countries will deliver on the commitments they have made. By evaluating policy characteristics of countries\u2019 net-zero targets, we can assign the targets credibility ratings, then estimate how greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and temperature are differentiated by our confidence in the targets. When we consider the credibility of current climate pledges, our assessment shows that the world remains far from delivering a safe climate future.", "In order to miss you have to aim", "I want to notice it s less than the last time. The previous studies on this subject was about 3.2\u00b0C\nStill not enough but there is some progress", "Of note is that their graph in the article closely matches [the graph they link to from Climate Action Tracker](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/), which is nice because (a) replication is good in science, and (b) that one's not paywalled.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the analysis in this paper is likely to be somewhat conservative due to two underlying assumptions:\n\n**First**, they project **current** policies of various types through the end of the century; however, examination of Climate Action Tracker's projections from [2018](https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/warming-projections-global-update-dec-2018/) vs. [2022](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/) shows that policies have had a tendency to get *significantly* more ambitious over time.  By projecting today's policies forward in time, they implicitly assume that process of improvement comes to a sudden stop.  \n\n**Second**, they project current **policies**; however, governmental policies are not the only driver of decarbonization.  Economics are a second major driver ([solar has been the cheapest electricity in history for several years now](https://www.carbonbrief.org/solar-is-now-cheapest-electricity-in-history-confirms-iea/)), and will arguably be a more impactful driver than policy in the next 10-20 years.\n\nBy contrast, major data-driven projections which do not make these assumptions tend to be more optimistic; for example, [the IEA projects an emissions peak around 2025](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/27/carbon-emissions-to-peak-in-2025-in-historic-turning-point-says-iea) and [an emissions reduction of around 15% by 2030](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/global-energy-related-co2-emissions-by-scenario-1990-2050).  This is still within the projection envelope of this paper, but near the bottom of it (it fairly closely matches the 2030 level of [SSP1-2.6 from IPCC WGI](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf) which results in 1.8C of warming by the end of the century).\n\nSo while this paper is a useful contribution in terms of categorizing and analysing current policies, like all papers it has limitations, notably the focus on \"current\" and \"policies\".", "Absolutely it can keep going especially if we do nothing till the environment is so toxic that most of us die.

I'd count the peer review as part of the scientific method, as it ensures the quality of the research. I don't count the weighing and performance grading and impact factors as part of the scientific method, taking your distinction between the two.\n\n Mostly because academia, in itself, is a system that is exclusionary - rather than inclusionary as the scientific method is. Which is to say - near anyone can be a scientist, but becoming an academic is exclusionary.\n\nThere is an overrepresentation of people in Academia whose parents are highly educated and themselves academics. The level of educations of parents correlates with whether their offspring are PhD holders. See here - for one study: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01425-4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01425-4)\n\nWhich is to say: Academia is a power structure, while science itself strives to be a merit based system.

As does the \"value\" and prestige of the journal published in, or the \"prestige\" of the university a scientist is part of. The way \\_performance\\_ is measured doesn't say much about the quality of the science.\n\nWe have advisory boards and ethic boards that ought to catch most \"unsound\" approaches.

Across species, subregions of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) are implicated in a variety of functions germane to pain, predictions, and learning. Human fMRI studies show that VMPFC activity tracks expectations about pain and mediates expectancy effects on pain-related activity in other brain regions. Prior lesion studies suggest that VMPFC may instead play a more general role in generating affective responses to painful stimuli. To test whether VMPFC is required to generate affective responses to pain or is more specifically involved in expectancy-based pain modulation, we studied responses to heat stimuli in five adults with bilateral surgical lesions of VMPFC and twenty healthy adults without brain damage. All participants underwent a quantitative sensory testing procedure followed by a pain expectancy task in which cues predicting either low or high pain were followed by intermittent medium intensity heat stimuli. Compared to adults without brain damage, individuals with VMPFC lesions reported larger differences in expected pain based on predictive cues and failed to update expectations following the covert introduction of unexpected medium temperature stimuli. Consistent with observed expectancy differences, subjective pain unpleasantness ratings in the VMPFC lesion group were more strongly modulated by cue during thermal stimulation. We found no group differences in overall pain sensitivity, nor in relationships between pain and autonomic arousal, suggesting that VMPFC damage specifically enhances the effect of expectations on pain processing, likely driven by impaired integration of new sensory feedback to update expectations about pain. These results provide essential new data regarding the specific functional contribution of VMPFC to pain modulation."], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "Masturbation originated about 40 million years ago within the primate order \u2014 an ancient trait associated with reproductive success in males, as yet more data on female masturbation required", "selftext": "", "id": "145nqyy", "url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjvvjx/jacking-off-has-evolutionary-benefits-going-back-40-million-years-study-says", "created_utc": 1686363025.0, "score": 577, "permalink": "/r/science/comments/145nqyy/masturbation_originated_about_40_million_years/", "comments": ["Welcome to r/science!

In a non ergodic system there are barriers that prevent that from happening.  Most real life scenarios (economically and psychologically) are non ergodic, even though most of the analysis that occurs with economic theory for example implicitly or explicitly assumes the system is ergodic. \n\nAs an example if you evaluated a game of Russian Roulette with a 6 chamber gun where the prize was $6000 for surviving, then the expected value assuming ergodic systems is $5000 so it would appear that you should play.  But the system is not ergodic, because if you lose, you cannot continue.  So the real expected value of the game is zero over time and it should be clear that despite the one time high payoff, the risk of ruin changes the actual payoff.  \n\nFrom that you could hypothesize that the female of our species has evolved with a better ability to understand and react to the non ergodic nature of dynamic systems.

What used to be a conversation about ambitious target setting now focuses increasingly on implementation and interventions to achieve these targets. This liminal transition from ambition to implementation is complex and presents deep ambiguities that are challenging for scientists to communicate and decision-makers to fathom. A critical question is whether we can believe that countries will deliver on the commitments they have made. By evaluating policy characteristics of countries\u2019 net-zero targets, we can assign the targets credibility ratings, then estimate how greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and temperature are differentiated by our confidence in the targets. When we consider the credibility of current climate pledges, our assessment shows that the world remains far from delivering a safe climate future.", "In order to miss you have to aim", "I want to notice it s less than the last time.

By projecting today's policies forward in time, they implicitly assume that process of improvement comes to a sudden stop.  \n\n**Second**, they project current **policies**; however, governmental policies are not the only driver of decarbonization.  Economics are a second major driver ([solar has been the cheapest electricity in history for several years now](https://www.carbonbrief.org/solar-is-now-cheapest-electricity-in-history-confirms-iea/)), and will arguably be a more impactful driver than policy in the next 10-20 years.\n\nBy contrast, major data-driven projections which do not make these assumptions tend to be more optimistic; for example, [the IEA projects an emissions peak around 2025](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/27/carbon-emissions-to-peak-in-2025-in-historic-turning-point-says-iea) and [an emissions reduction of around 15% by 2030](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/global-energy-related-co2-emissions-by-scenario-1990-2050).  This is still within the projection envelope of this paper, but near the bottom of it (it fairly closely matches the 2030 level of [SSP1-2.6 from IPCC WGI](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf) which results in 1.8C of warming by the end of the century).\n\nSo while this paper is a useful contribution in terms of categorizing and analysing current policies, like all papers it has limitations, notably the focus on \"current\" and \"policies\".", "Absolutely it can keep going especially if we do nothing till the environment is so toxic that most of us die.

There was pressure to dress conservatively in public, and act certain \"appropriate\" ways once you became an adult. That sentiment has eroded greatly.

This has lead to a lot more cross-generational commonality in interests.\n\nI do think this is part of it. The older people now are old enough to remember when video games were \"kid\" things. But then, there was historically a ton of cross generational interest in sports, at least for men.  I wonder if they are just so old that they never had the \"kid stuff\" mentality (especially as I don't understand most sports to have started as appealing to kids, but trickling down to them after adults played.  Though, really, amateur sports leagues that adults casually play in don't seem to happen as much anymore, either, but that could just be my own selection bias speaking.\n\n>Better sports science and fitness (among non-overweight folks) really leads to a lot more shared interest in physical activities as well. I, and many of my 40-something friends, still regularly play basketball and still feel very comfortable playing with younger 20-30 year old \"kids.\"\n\nMy 40-something parents played volleyball with the 20-somethings 25 years ago.  But they did slow down a lot in their late 40s and 50s.  Though part of that is that the 20-somethings were their kids and friends kids - and those kids finished school, got jobs, got married, etc. and stopped spending as much time with them and with fewer and older people, they were less inclined to play.  Plus my parents got broadband internet (well, DSL, but we thought we were flying then) and so that became my dad's primary entertainment, especially.\n\n>At the end of the day, I think there was just a perception that we would eventually become more like our parents as we got older, and the fact that never really happened is really interesting.\n\nThis is true, but I actually wonder if our parents (well, my generations') have something to do with it.  Boomers were such a big market segment and dominated a lot of media for a long time, so there's definitely cross-generation interest there. Particularly in regards to music (both technology and the customer base meant oldies stations, the hit songs used in movies 20 years later, etc.). There hasn't been the same kind of generational divide in subsequent generations.\n\nBut yeah, we still play video games, many of us adults watch at least some cartoons not targeting adults, we take vitamins that taste like gummi bears, etc.  And, too, since even before the Boomers reached adulthood, we've increasingly become more casual in clothing so that nowadays the difference in how teenagers and adults dress isn't so stark as it once was.", "We have pictures and they look old to me now even though I\u2019m the age they were now.

The findings suggest that exposure to binge-levels of alcohol during adolescence, when the brain is still developing, lead to long-lasting changes in the brain\u2019s ability to signal and communicate \u2014 potentially setting the stage for long-term behavioral changes and hinting towards the mechanisms of alcohol-induced cognitive changes in humans.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here,\u201d said Nikki Crowley, assistant professor in biology and biomedical engineering and Huck Early Chair in Neurobiology and Neural Engineering, \u201cis that if adolescent binge drinking knocks neurons off this trajectory, they might not be able to get back, even if the alcohol consumption stops.\u201d\n\nThe prefrontal cortex is a key brain region for executive functioning, risk assessment and decision-making.

Although nearly absent in most plants, taurine makes up as much as 0.1% of the body weight of animals. Humans synthesize taurine but depend on exogenous sources in early life when production is insufficient to support development, making it semi-essential. In species with very low synthesis, such as cats, taurine remains essential throughout adulthood; inadequate intake leads rapidly to retinal damage, immunological issues, and cardiomyopathy. In humans, small clinical trials of taurine supplementation in adults have suggested benefits in metabolic and inflammatory diseases. Yet, precisely what taurine does in most cases remains poorly understood. On page 1028 of this issue, Singh et al. (5) provide evidence that taurine maintains health in aged animal models.\n\nSingh et al. demonstrate that a decline in circulating taurine is a feature of aging in multiple species, including humans, with levels falling by \u223c80% over the human life span. They further found that mice lacking the major taurine transporter had shorter adult life spans. Supplementing taurine from middle age increased median life span by 10 to 23% in wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode worms) and 10 to 12% in wild-type mice. In mice, administering taurine was also associated with improvements in strength, coordination, and memory, as well as attenuation of multiple hallmarks of aging, including cellular senescence, mitochondrial and DNA damage, and chronic inflammation (\u201cinflammaging\u201d). In middle-aged rhesus macaques, 6 months of taurine supplementation led to positive effects on bone health, metabolic phenotypes, and immunological profiles.

As far as I know ischemia causes mitochondrial ROS to spill out into the cytosol, which sounds suspiciously similar to what VDAC1 is doing with ATP.

I wonder if cellular damage that impairs cellular function leads to a low energy state in the cell. Turning up mitochondrial function provides the cell with sufficient energy to repair itself and mitigate the effects of the damage. \n\nIn just about every degenerative disease, mitochondrial function is implicated. Even in aging where mTOR is a target. \n\nIt seems like a new 'cause' of a disease comes out weekly. Obviously there are not 27 causes of AD. There may be multiple ways to slow or stop the disease. Signal transduction pathways are cascades signal transducing proteins. The MEK kinase system has a series of three kinases MEK, MEKK, and MEKKK. The kinase cascade can be initiated by a receptor/ligand binding, at the other end the last kinase may activate a protein that regulates protein degradation. That is 5 targets for a single pathway. \n\nIt is easy to see why there are so many proposed causes. It is one pathway that has multiple molecularbtargets.\n\nBack to our friend beta amyloid. It comes from mis-processed precursor, APP. When APP is processed normally, the APP is clipped roughly in the middle of the beta amyloid segment. When it is mis-processed a protease clips APP in two alternative places to release the beta amyloid. Almost anything that stresses the neuron will cause an increase in beta amyloid. The beta amyloid forms these insoluble macromolecular structures, the characteristic AD plaques.\n\nTangles, the other pathological characteristic finding in AD has also been proposed as the cause of AD. Trisomy 21 and the Dutch mutation shifted the bullseye to beta amyloid over the tangle theory. There are many other amyloidosis diseases. Synuclein is deposited in Parkinson's. Transthyretin in FPA. All of these findings support a role for beta amyloid in AD. Calcium disregulation could be the critical second step in the pathology. Ca is known to play a role in neuronal cell death in stroke. One more brick on the load. Ca is sequestered in cell vesicles in an energy dependent process. Helping mitochondrial function will help increase energy level (ATP). Now the cell can sequester the Ca. So Ca will no longer activate say, cascades or PKC, alter cAMP and  cGMP levels. \n\nVDAC would fall into the Ca arena. It transports calcium. Reducing free intracellular Ca should slow the Ca mediated cell toxicity. I will have to catch up on VDAC.

Mice display a range of cognitive and motor deficits.\n\nRead more about the 5xFAD model - https://www.alzforum.org/research-models/5xfad-b6sjl", "I mean, it also sounds like they don't understand how animal models work and that **everyone** in science understands the fundamental limitations of such models.\n\nIf the argument is that plaque-based models are useless now that the paper they have been based on has been retracted, I think that's a good discussion to have.

Smoking alone causes diabetes by killing adipocytes, how else do you explain that other than membrane damage by foreign particles?", "> Membrane damage occurs in a lot of diseases. Did the membrane damage lead to the disease, or is membrane damage part of the disease process. Last do you get a death spiral where the disease cause membrane damage which in turn exacerbates the underlying disease which causes more membrane damage .......\n\nObviously it's the smoking and whatever risk factor that is the root cause, however membrane damage is the bottleneck or focal point where risk factors and disease features converge. I delved deep into atherosclerosis and I am certain that membrane damage is the cause (for lack of a better word), partly because [EPA but not DHA has been shown to improve atherosclerosis by stabilizing membranes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/tqi3g7/randomized_trials_show_fish_oil_reduces/). Trans fats are [remarkably resistent to oxidation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/bi034927y) so the LDL oxidation hypothesis is bunk, but once they are [incorporated into membranes they mimic membrane damage by increasing NF-\u03baB activation](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029600).\n\nI am not aware of any positive feedback loop in atherosclerosis, but I can think of two plausible ways this might happen: Increasing thickness of artery walls which makes them more prone to ischemia, or by making them vulnerable to pathogen invasion that requires NADPH oxidase to fight. I excluded oxidized LDL as a possible source of membrane damage, partly because trans fats do not oxidize, and partly because the liver rapidly takes up oxidized LDL via scavenger receptors. But I am all ears if you have a better idea of what could cause a feedback loop.\n\n\n> GUTs do not work except in a broad, general sense. Acid-base disregulation makes on susceptible to kidney stones, osteoporosis, and some types of arthritis. Similar models have been proposed for other disregulation.\n\nI think the membrane damage theory has sufficient basis as the unifying theory of chronic diseases, or at least a very strong explanatory element in disease models. Obviously it's not just the membrane damage, but all associated processes like membrane maintenance, lipoprotein circulation, and oxysterol/peroxylipid excretion.\n\n\n> Mitochondria seem to be involved in a lot of diseases. I wonder if cellular damage that impairs cellular function leads to a low energy state in the cell. Turning up mitochondrial function provides the cell with sufficient energy to repair itself and mitigate the effects of the damage. \n\nCells pad their membranes with cholesterol as prophylactic against damage, this cholesterol then interferes with mitochondrial function. https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/ajpheart.1982.242.2.H254, https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.215822, https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2014029117, https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article/117/4/e57/6104336?login=false\n\nI have seen some studies where better energy production leads to better cellular function, but I think what matters in chronic diseases is cholesterol availability and lipoprotein circulation. Ischemic cells might be able to generate energy via glycolysis, but they can not synthesize cholesterol and rely on external lipoproteins.\n\n\n> In just about every degenerative disease, mitochondrial function is implicated. Even in aging where mTOR is a target. \n\nChris Knobbe blames linoleic acid for making cardiolipin more vulnerable to lipid peroxidation, which would lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic diseases. I do not fully trust this theory yet, it is plausible but does not explain things as neatly as membrane damage, and is in fact only one instance of a more general membrane damage theory.\n\nAs for mTOR be aware that insulin and cellular overnutrition also activate mTOR, so it is plausible that the observed effects are due to these upstream pathways. For example insulin negatively affects vascular smooth muscle cells, and cellular overnutrition prevents LDL receptor expression, which creates a situation similar to familial hypercholesterolemia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR#Function, https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/52/10/2562/11025/Insulin-Affects-Vascular-Smooth-Muscle-Cell, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X17305132, Brown & Goldstein\n\n\n> It seems like a new 'cause' of a disease comes out weekly. Obviously there are not 27 causes of AD. There may be multiple ways to slow or stop the disease. Signal transduction pathways are cascades signal transducing proteins. The MEK kinase system has a series of three kinases MEK, MEKK, and MEKKK. The kinase cascade can be initiated by a receptor/ligand binding, at the other end the last kinase may activate a protein that regulates protein degradation. That is 5 targets for a single pathway. \n>\n> It is easy to see why there are so many proposed causes. It is one pathway that has multiple molecularbtargets.\n\nThis is why I like the membrane theory, it explains multiple risk factors and their interactions with each other. Membrane health is a weak point affected by many factors, and we only have a certain capacity to repair them. I am not that familiar with MAPK and secondary messenger systems, although I briefly investigated MAPK and JNK within the context of chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\n\n> Back to our friend beta amyloid. It comes from mis-processed precursor, APP. When APP is processed normally, the APP is clipped roughly in the middle of the beta amyloid segment. When it is mis-processed a protease clips APP in two alternative places to release the beta amyloid. Almost anything that stresses the neuron will cause an increase in beta amyloid. The beta amyloid forms these insoluble macromolecular structures, the characteristic AD plaques.\n\nI vaguely remember a decade ago reading something about cholesterol domains, and how they interfere with APP cleaving and give rise to amyloid beta. Can you confirm please whether this is truly the case, and can we integrate it with the previously mentioned prohpylactic cholesterol padding?\n\n\n> Tangles, the other pathological characteristic finding in AD has also been proposed as the cause of AD. Trisomy 21 and the Dutch mutation shifted the bullseye to beta amyloid over the tangle theory. There are many other amyloidosis diseases. Synuclein is deposited in Parkinson's. Transthyretin in FPA. All of these findings support a role for beta amyloid in AD. Calcium disregulation could be the critical second step in the pathology. Ca is known to play a role in neuronal cell death in stroke. One more brick on the load. Ca is sequestered in cell vesicles in an energy dependent process. Helping mitochondrial function will help increase energy level (ATP). Now the cell can sequester the Ca. So Ca will no longer activate say, cascades or PKC, alter cAMP and cGMP levels.\n\nBeta amyloid interventions spectacularly backfired though, there is only one medication approved amidst huge controversy. I am not keeping up with tau protein research, but last time I checked there were already two or three failed interventions. Alpha synuclein accumulation in Parkinson's disease was shown to be mainly due to lysosomal dysfunction, but I also remember some connections to mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nCalcium is a way too widely used substance, I investigated it but it is difficult to draw conclusions. Atherosclerotic calcification is the result of apoptosis, statins increase calcification because HMG-CoA reductase is responsible for suppressing apoptosis. It is possible neural death also comes from apoptosis, and calcification is just a side effect rather than the cause. But I would be glad to hear any information, because CFS also involves calcium dysregulation due to impaired ATP production. https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/qpp0s9/behavioral_characteristics_and_selfreported/hk4f4k4/, https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/ohmrls/hypothesis_predicts_major_failure_point_in/\n\n\n> VDAC would fall into the Ca arena. It transports calcium. Reducing free intracellular Ca should slow the Ca mediated cell toxicity. I will have to catch up on VDAC. I have not paid it much attention.\n\nI would investigate its effects on ROS, maybe VDAC1 is the missing piece that transports ATP and ROS from mitochondria into cytosol of ischemic cells.", "There is in fact a statue to their contribution in science.

Thanks to advances in research, lab and imaging tests are now available to help a doctor or researcher see biological signs of the disease, or biomarkers, in a living person.\"\n* [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350453):\n   * \"In the past, Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed for certain only after death when looking at the brain with a microscope revealed plaques and tangles. Health care providers and researchers are now able to diagnose Alzheimer's disease during life with more certainty. Biomarkers can detect the presence of plaques and tangles. Biomarker tests include specific types of PET scans and tests that measure amyloid and tau proteins in the fluid part of blood and cerebral spinal fluid.\"\n\nNotice how they dance around \"certain\" diagnosis? Why is that? Well, because AD is a disease of the brain, it has two main components that we can consider:\n\n1. Physiological changes to the brain - actual physical changes to cells and their surroundings\n2. Cognitive changes - changes to the person's behavior, cognition, etc.\n\nFor most of history, when a living patient came to a clinic, we were only really able to look at #2, the cognitive changes. People would come to the clinic with memory loss, changes to \"executive function\" (basic cognitive skills to plan tasks and achieve goals), confusion, apathy, depression, anxiety, etc., and they'd be given different neuropsychological exams, maybe some medications to mitigate symptoms. The doctor might decide they have \"dementia\" (an umbrella term for cognitive decline), and depending on the way their exams and symptoms panned out, they might get a probable diagnosis of AD, or some other dementia (i.e. dementia with Lewy bodies, a more Parkinsonian type of dementia, or frontotemporal dementia, a dementia that primarily affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain).\n\nWhy is it so difficult to get a 100% certain diagnosis? Well, that has to do with component #1 in our list above. While a patient may present to the clinic with symptoms that match a known dementia, we cannot confirm the disease until a pathologist is able to look at the brain under a microscope and identify ***which*** proteins are accumulating ***where*** in the patient's brain. As you can imagine, this is done post-mortem, so we cannot do this in living people (because you have to slice the brain up into hundreds of tissue sections on slides). The articles I linked allude to this notion of \"well, back in the day we couldn't diagnose AD with certainty, but now we have X Y Z technologies...\" and yes, we have better neuroimaging (brain scans like MRI, PET, etc.) and new biomarkers (we're developing ways of testing for these diseases using blood and cerebrospinal fluid), but we're still not at a 1:1 correlation between a patient's clinical presentation + tests and their final diagnosis/post-mortem pathological evaluation. We still frequently get cases in clinics that look very much like X disease, but when the patient passes away and the post-mortem analysis is done, we find all the pathological hallmarks (protein accumulation and changes to the tissue) specific to Y disease -- this is kind of what I linked in the previous comment you responded to. It's something we're still working on, and in fact, I'm personally working on such a project! But my boss is a neuropathologist and she likes to drive home the following point: as things stand now, you still NEED a medical doctor (pathologist) to examine the post-mortem tissue if you want a certain diagnosis of AD.\n\nFinally, I want to bring it to the main point, and the metaphorical \"pickle\" of that comment I made above - AD is a bit of a chicken-or-the-egg disease. The pathological hallmark of AD is the accumulation of both beta-amyloid proteins outside of neurons and tau proteins inside of neurons, called plaques and NFT (neurofibrillary tangles, not crypto pictures), respectively. When we look at a brain that has been heavily affected by AD, we find a lot of these plaques and NFTs all over the place, as well as shrinkage of brain areas (atrophy) and neuronal loss. We know that the accumulation of these proteins is not healthy for cells, and if you overexpress these proteins, you can force them to accumulate and kill neurons (that's how a lot of the \"mouse models\" of AD work), but we're not sure if that's what's driving AD-related changes to the brain or if it's something else that's causing plaques and NFTs, and we're just looking at the leftovers/consequences of a more invisible killer. So are we looking at the cause or the effect, the chicken or the egg? And people have a TON of theories about how this works, how the pathology \"spreads\" and such, but the fact of the matter is that while we have a lot of great paths for investigation, we're still not sure yet. And that's why I still have a job. I'm trying to figure it out :)\n\nHope that helps, and grateful that there are people outside of the field who are enthusiastic about what we do!", "Mice have most of the same genes as humans but it seems like they aren't all used in the same way.\n\nThere's a few human genetic mutations that are known to lead to specific cancers:  mutations in Rb lead to Retinablastoma in humans, mutations in BRCA1 lead to breast cancer in humans.\n\nIn mice, mutations in Rb lead to tumors in pituitary glands, mutations in BRCA1 lead to nothing.\n\nHere \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/nrc1235\nis a good summary.\n\n(I should say that maybe this is all 10-15 years out of date, so if things have improved someone who knows should chime in.)", "It would look worse.

But, regardless of whether it\u2019s major suppliers trying to recoup after a seizure or it\u2019s street sellers trying to make ends meet during a drought, the problem is that after the police do the right thing and remove illegal drugs from neighborhoods, people start dying more. My first thought was what another commenter said, street drugs aren\u2019t reliable recipes. So long as the fda doesn\u2019t regulate it, it doesn\u2019t get regulated. Remember, the death rate goes up, not from zero, just up. I can pretty much guarantee that under normal circumstances autopsies aren\u2019t done on drug overdoses to determine if it was too much of a good recipe that killed them or it was some garbage that would have killed anybody. Point is, most addicts know their limits. I would assume most over doses were bad batches. As an example, back in 99 they had to pull RedBulls off the shelves because the ephedrine in it was mixing with the heroin mixed in mdma pills and causing overdoses in teenagers at raves. Likewise, there was always the danger of ecstasy pills that used both speed and opiates which would cause heart attacks. I took one pill once. It made me itch. I took a Benadryl and spent the next three hours vomiting to the raging colors and music in my head while floating in and out of consciousness. I almost died but was too messed up to ask to go to the hospital and my friends just left me in the grass because I just looked sleepy. An od is probably not usually an od so much as it is a bad mixture, which is what this article makes me feel. Take all the drugs off the streets, overdoses go up. Overdosing on what? Doesn\u2019t make sense unless you think about how quickly new \u2018stock\u2019 shows up; rushed, or faked. I\u2019m still for legalization in order to regulate under medical care, but as far as this situation goes, the only thing I can think of is community notice of seizures to warn users that the police have seized the usual drugs and do not trust what fills the void, kinda like handing out condoms and clean needles.  Honestly, I got one more suggestion but I think it\u2019s illegal so don\u2019t do it. But, if drug dealers were organized then when a seizure occurs in one area, surplus from another area can fill the void with the safe stuff. Sounds horrible but, at least it\u2019s consistent for the users. Reality is, the marijuanna transition is working, prohibition was ironed out, people are even figuring out that that third cup of coffee in the morning makes you afternoon sleepy. See, here\u2019s the real issue. It\u2019s not the drug that the gov seems to be fighting, it\u2019s how addictive they each are. Meth and heroin are horribly addictive (and intense.) So, it\u2019s about regulating drugs without losing the functionality of the person. That\u2019s why lsd is illegal. Not because it opens up your third eye. But because the trip lasts eight hours. If it was legal it would be so easy to just sit around and dose all day. And, that\u2019s why you never hear about cocaine. Not because of some Cuban conspiracy, but because people who do coke tend to hold jobs so there\u2019s no societal suffering. Just keep it quiet and no one knows. Same with prescription pills. That\u2019s why it took so long to get weed legalized, people had to prove that society will still function if it\u2019s legalized. To be honest, I bet pharma could put the drug trade out of business with morphine and pure cocaine to supplant the dirtier addictions but gov is gonna have to work in mental health evaluations in to their uses. But, at least they\u2019d be clean, regulated versions. I once got a bottle of morphine. 30 10mg time release pills. Woke up at nine, bought a mountain at seven eleven to take it, then made jewelry at the beach for ten hours. 30 days straight. No complications, no cravings. Still, some people won\u2019t be able to regulate themselves. Me, five 20 oz Red Bulls a day if I could. But the point is, this is a hard one to see clearly because it\u2019s not about addictions (else we\u2019d be discussing all drugs, not just street drugs.) it\u2019s about a particular \u2019substitution\u2019 of a removed drug. So, this is not a psychology question. It\u2019s a procedural one. And, I don\u2019t know how this stuff works, let alone how it should work.", ">There is a tremendously judgemental \"they got what they deserved\" attitude that is unlikely to disappear any time soon.\n\nThis is exactly my thought when I heard one of the largest fentanyl importer busts turned out to be the head of the San Jose Police Union doing the importing.\n\nI guarantee you she was fine with people using the product dying because they \"deserved\"  it.", "Which is a great explanation of why decriminalization seems important.

If their tolerance drops, then their regular dose could now become a fatal dose.\n\nIt's not uncommon for someone to be addicted, and maybe they take 10 heroin's per session (idk how they measure heroin), but then their dealer is out or arrested or whatever, so they have to find more. It takes a couple days, maybe a week, and their tolerance drops. They finally find some, do their normal dose, but now their normal dose is waaay stronger than they thought it would be because they have actually never gone that long without heroin in over a year, so they just don't realize how much of a tolerance they had or how fast it can drop.\n\nNow if the new dealer happens to have stronger stuff, then this becomes even more of an issue.\n\nEdit: a word\n\nEdit: also, it's important to know that when people OD on opiates, they usually don't die from the direct effects, but the indirect effects, like choking on their puke while passed out.

I'm sure opiates can kill you directly as well, but from what I understand, the main thing that kills people is the indirect effects such as throwing up and then choking in your sleep, or just straight up forgetting to breath. That person could possibly have survived if they were just on their side, unlike the example with ibuprofen where it just straight up shuts down your organs.", "When supply is seized n taken out of circulation, this increases demand. The RC (research chem) market is booming n offers infinite tweaks to existing opioids like fentanyl. The newer they are, the cheaper they are, and in my experience, the stronger they are. This is the whole reason fent replaced heroin, it used to be much cheaper AND much stronger than H, so why go get more H when u could spend less than half the investment on a newer, stronger product.\n\nNow \"zenes\" and fent analogs have replaced fent, and due to their legal status (not yet scheduled federally), they tend to be even cheaper. \n\nIt's essentially supply n demand, the less clean heroin on the market, the more likely stronger/cheaper alternatives will find their way into circulation to compensate whilst still making profit.\n\nProhibition seems to inherently increase the overall potency of the drug supply, the more we take away prescription drugs or even pure (fentfree) heroin, the more cheaper, stronger alternatives gain popularity.\nA single seizure is just a single data point in larger economic process driven by circumvention of the law.

You can detect basic ChatGPT outputs pretty easily because it writes very formally. But if you add any sort of complexity to your prompt, I don't see how anyone could detect it.

Explain what an electron is in 300 characters or less\", ChatGPT gives the output: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>An electron is a tiny, buzzing thing that moves around in atoms.

These are researchers, not professional authors, so they can just feed the AI their raw notes and not waste time writing the paper. Readers can ask the AI to find specific information or reword it to suit their needs.", "The future of generative AI in scientific literature is interesting.\n\nGenerative AI can be legitimately helpful in just getting started. There are aspects of writing papers that feel menial and time consuming to researchers. Making figures can be a pain and sometimes it can be hard to just get started writing. I can see cases where properly prompting generative AI models can be very useful in allowing researchers to spend more time researching and less time using photoshop, formatting writing for a specific journal, or thinking of the best way to start explaining a concept.\n\nIn scientific spaces especially, generative AI should only be used as an assistants to researchers, and generate content based on a researcher's results and prompts. Giving such results and prompts to the generative models available now leads to all sorts of problems with privacy concerns and stealing data. Hallucinations don't seem to be an issue when you're giving good prompts, though.\n\nIn the next few years, I would not be surprised to see universities rolling out super computers whose only purpose is to run generative AI models that must be prompted and in ways that are data safe such as to protect the university and its researchers.", "I'll await replication before I get too excited.Not that it will be relevant in 6 months either way.\n\nIt also seems like an odd thing to focus your efforts.

They used the same prompt (\"Can you produce a 300 to 400-word summary on this topic: \") just with a different topic, so it makes sense that ChatGPT would produce stylistically similar outputs every time. So what they actually detect is whether a text was generated by ChatGPT using this specific prompt and without any further proofreading or editing. That's absolutely not the same as detecting whether ChatGPT generated the text in general.\n\nThat also makes these results meaningless for any practical purposes because you won't know which prompts people used to generate their text, and most people would proofread and make manual changes afterward anyway.\n\nThis is like saying you have a method to determine whether an accessory was handcrafted or mass-produced but in reality, all you're able to detect is whether it was produced by one specific machine with zero human supervision.", "And the 1% return false are cosmic ray bit-flips?", "<Beep!> ChatGpt detected !", ">They specifically write that it was a proof of concept work.\n\nThey also use a clickbait title suggesting they're capable of \"distinguishing academic science writing from humans or ChatGPT with over 99% accuracy\" and they're absolutely not clear about the limited scope of their study in the summary  (which I assume is supposed to be the abstract?) either.\n\nAlso, there has been plenty of work on this topic already but they don't even cover any related work, to begin with.\n\nI don't see how this paper would've ever been accepted in any serious CS/AI/ML conference/journal.", "Rome wasn't built in a day, but this \"proof of concept\" certainly was.", "Pursuing this is incomprehensibly moronic and only creates an arms race between these two groups attempting to monetize AI to create and AI to \"find\".\n\nThis does nothing to actually solve the problem.", "I wrote this comment using chatgpt!", "It's not about can he do it but about saving time with AI.", "One of the most boring part is writing the introduction section of a paper which usually states well known things setting the background and the motivation and often sounds like hot air for the most part.

What follows is the result:\n\n*The task of drafting an introductory section of a paper can feel tedious, largely due to its focus on establishing background information and providing motivation - elements that might already be widely known. These parts, despite often feeling like unnecessary fillers, could certainly use some assistance in their execution.*\n\n*Take, for instance, papers on wireless networks. They invariably start by emphasizing the significance of wireless networks and their projected importance in the future. Such repetitious preambles, while clear and perhaps redundant, are still somehow expected by reviewers due to ingrained conventions of academic writing.*\n\n*For authors for whom English is not a first language, AI like GPT could potentially provide valuable assistance in revising parts of their papers to ensure they meet standards of formal readability.*\n\nPretty good, I would say.", "One depressing aspect of science writing is essentially cultural.\n\nIn theory as long as you fully describe your methods accurately and clearly your actual writing style shouldn't matter.\n\nBut in reality papers will be rejected if they're not written in a distinctive academic style that is largely a cultural shibboleth.  This mostly impacts non-english speakers but also anyone not from a long science background regardless of whether their actual methodology is fine.\n\nAnd yes, it's only a fraction of the work. You spend 6 months running numbers, doing analysis etc and then you have to actually write up the paper. \n\nOften, if that paper was being written as a blog post, you could provide all the detailed info that another researcher would need quite easily, but for journals it's demanded in a literary style that apes the early 20th century British upper class.\n\nTL;DR A big fraction of the most dysfunctional things about science revolve around publishers and publishing.\n\nBeing able to dump a bunch of information, statements and descriptions of methods into a box and ask for them in a style suitable for a research paper that you can then check over to make sure it's not mangled anything is valuable.", "I agree that humans still need to do the majority of the work, but the ability for the models to save time is unreal. \n\nFor example, some figures in our lab take humans hours to make.

Lipid rafts are key elements in synaptic plasticity, and their modification with aging alters interactions and distribution of signaling molecules, such as glutamate receptors and ion channels involved in memory formation, eventually leading to cognitive decline. In the present study, we have analyzed, in vivo, the effects of dietary supplementation of n-3 LCPUFA on the lipid structure, membrane microviscosity, domain organization, and partitioning of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors in hippocampal lipid raffs in female mice. The results revealed several lipid signatures of \u201clipid rafts aging\u201d in old mice fed control diets, consisting in depletion of n-3 LCPUFA, membrane unsaturation, along with increased levels of saturates, plasmalogens, and sterol esters, as well as altered lipid relevant indexes. These changes were paralleled by increased microviscosity and changes in the raft/non-raft (R/NR) distribution of AMPA-R and mGluR5. Administration of the n-3 LCPUFA diet caused the partial reversion of fatty acid alterations found in aged mice and returned membrane microviscosity to values found in young animals. Paralleling these findings, lipid rafts accumulated mGluR5, NMDA-R, and ASIC2, and increased their R/NR proportions, which collectively indicate changes in synaptic plasticity. Unexpectedly, this diet also modified the lipidome and dimension of lipid rafts, as well as the domain redistribution of glutamate receptors and acid-sensing ion channels involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, likely modulating functionality of lipid rafts in memory formation and reluctance to age-associated cognitive decline."], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "70% of Food, Drinks Within Arm\u2019s Reach Are Unhealthy.

The division of labor creates specialized behavioral groups within an animal society which are sometimes referred to as 'castes'. Eusociality is distinguished from all other social systems because individuals of at least one caste usually lose the ability to perform at least one behavior characteristic of individuals in another caste. Eusocial colonies can be viewed as superorganisms.\n\n(Since I expect someone will ask, the Wikipedia article goes on to mention that some researchers have argued that humans are weakly eusocial, but that this is a contentious view. So consider eusociality more in the context of e.g. bees, ants, etc., as with the termites discussed in this research.)\n\nSo the title on its own suggests that this alarm behaviour (\u201cethology\u201d) predates their highly organized colonies and specializations. Reading the abstract, it seems they determined this by looking at alarm signalling behaviour across a number of related species, and inferred that the vibration signalling happened with a common ancestor to the species studied here. The abstract refers to the vibration signalling as an \u201cethological synapomorphy\u201d. \u201cEthological\u201d refers to the study of animal behaviour, and \u201csynapomorphy\u201d to an evolved trait, specifically one evolved by a most recent common ancestor. (A synapomorphy is a special case of an [_apomorphy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apomorphy_and_synapomorphy), an evolved trait not held by an ancestor species. A synapomorphy is shared, implying its development by that most recent common ancestor I already mentioned.)\n\nTL;DR: termites evolved this vibration-signalling behaviour before they were even the species of termites we recognize today.

This study documented changes in the prevalence of pack characteristics among the top-selling cigarette products in the US in 2018 and 2021.\r  \n\r  \nMethods\r  \nThe 50 cigarette packs with the highest national unit sales in US convenience stores in 2018 and 2021 were identified using Nielsen's Scantrack data and subsequently purchased. Packs were coded for features such as dominant color(s), descriptive text, and promotional language. Descriptive analyses conducted in 2022 weighted by total annual unit sales compared the prevalence of pack characteristics between years.\r  \n\r  \nResults\r  \nThree brands \u2013 Marlboro, Newport, and Camel \u2013 constituted over 80% of pack sales among the top-selling products. Packs with red as a dominant color grew less popular between years (33.3% vs. 29.5%), while green became more prevalent (25.2% vs. 28.9%), consistent with a rise in the proportion of menthol sales. Prevalence of descriptors such as \u201cflavor\u201d and \u201cfresh\u201d decreased from 46.0% to 39.4% and 9.7% to 5.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, prevalence of promotional language (e.g., rewards programs) increased from 60.9% to 69.0%.\r  \n\r  \nConclusions\r  \nThe use of visual and named colors remains common, which can implicitly communicate sensory or health-related attributes. Moreover, promotions may help recruit and retain consumers in the context of more restrictive tobacco control policies and price increases.

We used a representative survey of 3,510 people living in five US states (Colorado, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, and Texas) conducted in 2022. Individuals provided information on past experiences with firearms, perceptions of threat and neighborhood safety, discrimination, and tolerance of uncertainty alongside demographic items. The analysis was conducted in November 2022. Past experiences with firearms and prior victimization are associated with increased firearm ownership and carrying practices. Threat sensitivity is associated with owning more guns while poorer perceptions of neighborhood safety correspond with owning fewer guns but greater risk for unsafe storage practices like storing a loaded gun in a closet or drawer. Intolerance of uncertainty is associated with owning fewer guns and lower risk for carrying outside of the home but greater risk for unsafe storage. Prior experience of discrimination is associated with risk for carrying firearms outside of the home. Demographic characteristics related to sex, rurality, military service, and political conservatism predict risky firearm-related behaviors related to firearm ownership, carrying frequency, and unsecure storage. Taken together, we find firearm ownership and risky firearm behaviors (e.g. carrying, unsafe storage) are more prominent among groups such as politically conservative males living in rural areas while also being influenced by threatening experiences, uncertainty, and perceptions of safety.", "Would they classify previous sexual assault/rape as any of these categories ?", "They paid to study that?

At the end of the temperature-sensitive window, your sex outcome depends on all the temperatures you experienced.\n\nOh, and it gets more complicated than that too - because your sex is also influenced by genetics (some parents have more female or more male babies on average), oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the nest, moisture conditions\u2026 even the mother\u2019s age can influence their offspring\u2019s sex. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been shying away from using \u2018temperature dependent sex determination\u2019 specifically, these all exist on a spectrum of genetically-influenced environmental sex determination. \n\nNow in sea turtles which are probably the best studied, hotter temperatures produce females. We\u2019re seeing issues now where beach temperatures are so hot, it\u2019s feminizing all the babies. One green sea turtle study found > 99% females in nests, and this was like 10 years ago.\n\nFor your second question, if you\u2019re getting at the evolutionary reasons for environmental sex determination, you\u2019re on the right track. It is believed that environmental sex determination is ancient in vertebrates, dinosaurs maybe even had it, and it\u2019s present in lots of fishes. We now believe that this phenomenon persisted through evolution because it matches sex to fitness.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re a fish (like sea bass or flatfish, which have TSD) and you\u2019re a big fish, you\u2019re probably going to be more fit if you\u2019re a female (you have the potential to make more eggs). Now coincidentally, the temperatures that lead to faster growth and bigger fish are also the temperatures that make females in this species. In contrast, middling egg temperatures generally make bigger snapper babies. In this species, males are usually bigger and have to fight for territory and mating. So it\u2019s advantageous for a male to be produced at those good temperatures that lead to better growth and bigger adults. \n\nEndothermy probably has something to do with a loss of environmental sex determination on an evolutionary scale. Why maintain this system across evolutionary time if embryonic temperatures don\u2019t have large effects on your adult life? But even then it\u2019s not complete. Some birds have a degree of environmental sex determination despite mostly being endothermic and also having distinct sex chromosomes. Some turtles (eg soft shells) have \u2018homomorphic sex chromosomes\u2019 (they pass down a sex chromosome, but they don\u2019t look different like X or Y), and actually don\u2019t have strong environmental sex determination. \n\nWe don\u2019t know why this happens specifically, but there are probably either reasons that selection maintained environmental sex determination (advantages to individual fitness) or selection wasn\u2019t really happening (not strong enough advantages or disadvantages, so they were lost in noise) or maybe genetic sex determination had some population advantages (like balanced sex ratios). Or maybe it\u2019s totes random - stochastic maintenance of systems. There\u2019s people who aren\u2019t me who are working out evolutionary causes and consequences right now :)\n\nSorry for the long explanation. These are good questions!", "All good - no harm.

This finding is important and might be explained by two symmetric reasons. On one hand, traditional media sources are more often run by public institutions than social media, and therefore the information published through classical media sources might be more likely to be associated with official opinions that are less critical about vaccination. On the other hand, the diffusion of vaccine-related misinformation on social media might exacerbate the levels of vaccine hesitancy and hamper progress toward vaccine-induced herd immunity as argued by Muric et al. based on a description and assessment of data posts on Twitter33. Thus, further research is necessary to understand why media sources are so relevant for vaccine hesitancy and public policy should address the media-specific causes and mechanisms when allocating pro-vaccine campaigns.", "People who believe the vaccine is bad don't get the vaccine.

For example, I think only \\~30% of Bulgaria has a single dose of the vaccine.

In reality, while the authors say that this study is \"in line\" with other, ***different*** studies that support this conclusion, nothing ***in the study posted here*** actually examines beliefs in vaccine misinformation.\n\nExamination of the study seems to make this clear. While they examine some measures of vaccine related *fear* and then break down those measures on things like trust in different institutions, age, education, economic stability, etc., there isn't a single statement or question presented in the study to actually measure how much misinformation the individual has been exposed to nor how much they actually believe.\n\nYou can't credibly claim that the study shows that belief in vaccine misinformation is a predictor of vaccine hesitancy if the study doesn't actually attempt to measure how much the individuals believe in vaccine misinformation.\n\nIf the headline is generated by the OP (as opposed to a direct quote) and it doesn't actually match the findings of the study (or, in this case, what the study even examined), then it seems to clearly violate standards against editorialized titles.", ">...especially because of conspiracy beliefs (COVID risk is exaggerated and/or COVID does not exist).\n\nThis is a strange way for the authors to frame it here.

Yeah, it certainly ***can*** be a conspiracy belief depending on how extreme of a view you took on ***how much*** it was being exaggerated. I'm not sure it is a conspiracy belief though to think that ***some*** level of exaggeration happened. \n\nFor example, leaked text messages show Matt Hancock, the former UK health secretary, literally talk about trying to leverage COVID information specifically to induce extreme fear in the public (\"We frighten the pants of everyone with the new strain.\"). \n\nAlternatively, we know that pretty much all major subsets of the American public, regardless of their age, gender, political leaning, or where they got their COVID information drastically overestimated the risk that COVID posed towards children.  Some groups overestimated the relative risk of death to children by a factor of a thousand or more.

Still, why would particles appearing somewhere reasonably far away from the black hole or other object and going away, reduce the mass of something they didn't interact with?", "Hmmm, I would be curious to know more about the particles created beyond the horizon too. The particle creations require energy from somewhere though. I'm assuming that they get their energy from the blackhole somehow. After that, it's back to the normal explanation, which is that half the energy is returned to the black hole and the other half escapes, leaving the black hole with less energy/mass than it started with. We'll need to wait for a real physicist to explain how pair creation can draw energy from a black hole outside of its event horizon.", "Energy and time are conjugate variables with an uncertainty relation, like position and momentum. So over brief periods of time fluctuations in energy can be large enough to allow virtual particles to appear, but they have to disappear too, to maintain empirical energy conservation. That's why they're called virtual particles, if they lasted long enough to directly effect the world then they'd be real particles. The pairs of virtual particles are most likely to be light weight and one is an antiparticle.\n\nThe authors are saying that gravity, being stronger nearer the source, exerts an asymmetric affect on a pair of virtual particles when one is nearer the source than the other, so one of the pair can join the source object and the other can escape.\n\nIf the one that escapes is made of normal matter, then the other annihilates a particle when it joins the source object, so the net effect is as-if to have teleported a particle from the source object to somewhere else.\n\nIt seems to me that the effect would be opposite if it were the antiparticle that escaped, and I would think that would be equally likely, so I'm not clear on how this mechanism has any long term impact on the source object.", "Your explanation would seem to lead to a spontaneous increase in the mass of the black hole and creation of a particle outside the black hole.", "You're right, I had to look up the Schwinger effect on Wikipedia to understand better. It seems that in these new findings, the particle pairs are created from the energy in the gravitational field. So if it takes 2X energy to make them, and one goes into the source object, the other can still escape, taking X mass/energy with it. Since there's no event horizon involved or momentary energy conservation issue, I think they could even both escape, likely annihilating and escaping as light.", "That makes sense.

These landscapes are characterized by differences in socioeconomic context, habitat suitability and patch connectedness. Identifying which spatial differences enable outbreaks of pests, pathogens and invasive species will improve targeted control efforts.We tested hypotheses to explain the distribution and demography of puncturevine Tribulus terrestris, a human-dispersed invasive plant in Boise, a city in the western United States. We hypothesized an increase in puncturevine infestations near low-valued properties with a high proportion of bare ground, the species' preferred microhabitat, that are well connected on the urban road network. To test these hypotheses, we collected data on the abundance, emergence and persistence of reproductive plants in transects spanning >100 km of our study city. We then used hierarchical Bayesian models to evaluate the impacts of spatial covariates on puncturevine distribution and demography.Bare ground cover consistently increased abundance, emergence and persistence of puncturevine, indicating the overarching importance of suitable establishment sites for this invasive species.Property value had the strongest impact on puncturevine abundance and was the most important main effect in the model for puncturevine emergence. In both models, lower-valued properties had a higher risk of puncturevine occurrence.The effects of road network connectivity depended on bare ground cover, with the highest predicted abundance and emergence of puncturevine in patches with low connectivity on the road network and high bare ground cover. Understanding these relationships will require data that can disentangle seed dispersal from establishment limitations.Identifying characteristics of urban patches that promote outbreaks of harmful species will improve the effectiveness and equity of control efforts. The prevalence of puncturevine in lower-valued properties is cause for concern as the plant impedes bicycle transportation, with the potential for disproportionate impacts on marginalized groups that lack resources to repair punctured tires.

I begin by reviewing extant research on PTG, with a focus on measurement and conceptual issues.  \n>  \n>Expanding on arguments made by others, I distinguish between three forms of PTG, 1) perceived PTG, which is an individual's beliefs about their own PTG, 2) genuine PTG, which is veridical growth following adversity, and 3) illusory PTG, which is motivated fabrications of PTG.  \n>  \n>**Perceived PTG is extremely common, as over half of individuals exposed to a potentially traumatic event (PTE) report moderate or greater levels of PTG. I review evidence that most self-reports of PTG are greatly exaggerated and argue that perceived PTG is mostly illusory PTG.**  \n>  \n>**I propose five reasons for the disconnect between perceived PTG and genuine PTG, including design flaws in the current measurements, emotional biases that favor perceived PTG, the inherent appeal of PTG, cultural expectations, and problems of definition.**  \n>  \n>**I then review the empirical evidence concerning the prevalence rate of genuine PTG, coming to the bold conclusion that the occurrence of genuine PTG is very rare, contradicting current fundamental beliefs about PTG.**  \n>  \n>I recommend researchers focus on the key areas of measurement and etiology of genuine PTG, which are necessary to create interventions that foster genuine PTG. I conclude by outlining a path to steer the scientific progression of PTG back in the right direction.\n\nAuthor: Professor Adriel Boals, Director of Behavioral Science Program at the University of North Texas.", "If I'm understanding this right: \n\nWhat doesn't kill you, does not, in fact, make you stronger, your suffering does not actually build character, and most everyone flunks out of the school of hard knocks.", "As someone suffering CPTSD, I would say a huge driver of illusory PTG is cultural/social pressure. People do not want to believe suffering is for nothing, and simultaneously want to disbelieve that they need to take any action to help alleviate the social ills that worsen, perpetuate, and cause trauma (i.e. poverty, social ostracism, homelessness, income inequality, etc). After all, if trauma just makes a person stronger, is it so bad? Why should anyone burden themselves emotionally or expend energy trying to engage with solutions or in comforting us when they believe that, ultimately, our suffering is 'worth it'. They demand that we perform this improvement and assuage their negative feelings surrounding our suffering. 8 of 10 people will respond to admissions of trauma by saying: 'but it made you stronger, right?' No! It has made my life extremely, exceedingly difficult, in fact.\n\nBut that social pressure is strong, and many of us want to believe this 'trauma is good for growth' narrative, because we also do not want our suffering to be for naught. Many traumatized folks delay/deny/avoid treatment due to this fallacy so in the long-run our collective denial is hurting us. We want to be accepted so we carry the water for this cultural concept. Many deny themselves help or understanding by papering over our wounds with heart warming platitudes.\n\nThis attitude is rampant in US society. They want us to make them feel good/okay about life/society and insist that we value our damage as some sort of opportunity for growth. It is galling and harmful. Unless we are ex-military, our suffering is not seen as honorable or acceptable. When I struggle, I am called a downer and alienate people. My emotional dysregulation scares people and makes them think I am an essentially bad person to be around; that I am dangerous. Further, many struggle to accept that behavior is wired into our nervous system and that I am not simply choosing to be 'dramatic', 'self-absorbed', or 'negative'.\n\nPlease, I am begging you, listen and empathize with us and stop pressuring us into performing 'redemption' narratives ready made for an Oprah interview.", "this is really dark and sad and not at all what i needed to read tonight", "Also - maybe there is PTG but that is from the place of trauma i.e. the baseline gets knocked lower and people grow significantly from the new baseline, but not above where they were before it.", "Antifragility isn\u2019t easy, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s still not worth pursuing imo.

There is indeed a medical condition with a definition that is caused by trauma. Anything that causes PTSD or CPTSD is trauma. There is no need to confuse this issue with some ontological discussion of what a word means to people, or how people are impacted differently by similar events. That is not at issue.", "I think this is still discounting something.\n\nLike in your example, even if it's not proper forgiveness, if you believe you've forgiven them and now you don't hold the regret, anger, or whatever emotion plagued you before the forgiveness, aren't you still growing in that case?", "[removed]", "It is a thing in personality disorders but more generally it's pretty common behavior in survival situations.

The victim may eventually understand what's going on clearly enough (this part is growth). They might start doing what the abuser does in other similar situations, so that they now win those situations too (though not necessarily against the same abuser). The reason for that could be as simple as \"this is a method that I've seen work, now I know how to use it too\", rather than something that requires a psychiatric label.\n\nThey may (rightly or wrongly) see that as growth for themselves, in that they have overcome their perceived difficulties in such situations. They may not see (or not want to see) the detriment in it, e.g. harming or pushing away the people they do this to. Or downplay such detriment, reasoning that they've overcome it themselves, so it's minor.\n\nThey may not look for other ways of handling the situation that don't involve such abusive behavior, thinking they've grown enough.

Our struggles never EXCUSE bad behavior, but can provide context to help with forgiveness and understanding; and in helping to communicate better moving forward. Anyone who is asking you to totally excuse their harmful behavior, without taking responsibility and striving to make improvements, is doing a poor job of life and their social responsibilities, and should not be excused--whether they are traumatized or not.

And we know nature has this acuity and intelligence. It\u2019s responded to similar calamities and waves before. We don\u2019t stand a chance against nature for we are but an extension of, not the apex here on this planet. We can shape our biomes sure.. but not on the scale things are changing. Adaptations are needed if the species wants to survive the next 10,000 years for sure. And I don\u2019t mean force changes and try and half ass filling plot holes. We will lose every time. A reset may be its only plausible outcome for survival. I mean push any predator in a corner.. even a human.. and you\u2019ll see their will to survive (arguable instinct) arrests every notion and motion. Survival is the root of existence.

The NMA statistical approach was built on a frequency framework. The effect size was estimated by the standardized mean difference (SMD) and a 95% confidence interval (CI). We compiled a relative ranking of the competing interventions based on their surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA).\r  \nResults:\r  \nNMA showed that high-frequency repeated TMS (HF-rTMS) improved GCF compared with sham stimulation (SMD\u2009=\u20091.95; 95% CI: 0.47\u20133.43), while dual-tDCS improved memory performance versus sham stimulation significantly (SMD\u2009=\u20096.38; 95% CI: 3.51\u20139.25). However, various NIBS stimulation protocols revealed no significant impact on enhancing attention, executive function, or activities of daily living. There was no significant difference between the active stimulation protocols for TMS and tDCS and sham stimulation in terms of safety. Subgroup analysis demonstrated an effect favoring activation site of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (SUCRA\u2009=\u200989.1) for enhancing GCF and bilateral DLPFC (SUCRA\u2009=\u200999.9) stimulation for enhancing memory performance.\r  \nConclusion:\r  \nThe HF-rTMS over the left DLPFC appears to be the most promising NIBS therapeutic option for improving global cognitive performance after stroke, according to a comparison of numerous NIBS protocols. Furthermore, for patients with post-stroke memory impairment, dual-tDCS over bilateral DLPFC may be more advantageous than other NIBS protocols.

Besides, they exhibit long life since they are not subject to chemical degradation as in conventional batteries.\n\nA supercapacitor device consists of an electrode, electrolyte and a current collector.

A specially prepared \u2018down-conversion\u2019 phosphor is introduced before the quartz window to facilitate light-induced charging.\n\n\u201cDevices that are powered by such supercapacitors can be charged by simply keeping them under light and can be powered even when we are on the move for days or weeks. In the case of electric vehicles, supercapacitors can provide short-term boosts that will enable them to accelerate faster and climb hilly terrain with considerable ease. Such light-powered applications can also be used in space applications and satellites by powering remote sensors and providing back-up power during power outages,\u201d said Dr. Rani.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit - formatting"], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "New history looks at the distance learning sciences that inspired public media in the 1930s.", "selftext": "", "id": "146dlvm", "url": "https://niemanreports.org/articles/public-media-history-book/", "created_utc": 1686437468.0, "score": 1, "permalink": "/r/science/comments/146dlvm/new_history_looks_at_the_distance_learning/", "comments": ["Welcome to r/science!
