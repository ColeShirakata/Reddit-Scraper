The most terrible but inevitable losses are people. And unfortunately, military equipment that cannot be destroyed has not yet been created. But today's wars take place in two dimensions - real and informational. Information battles are no less fierce. And they also have certain tasks, rules and laws. For example, any party to an armed conflict seeks to show the enemy's losses and classifies its losses during the active phase of hostilities. Why? Because the more information about the enemy is publicly available, the easier it is to calculate their capabilities and plans. In addition to intelligence, which is now very difficult for the Russians on our territory, there are other ways to extract the necessary information by throwing provocations into the information space. In this way, you can force the other side to give out as much information about itself as possible. For example, by encouraging justifications and refutations. To do this, very inflated figures are thrown at us in the expectation that we will indignantly begin to refute and give out some data or indirect references to them. Or, for example, information about the disappearance of the Commander-in-Chief or other commanders is being thrown around, expecting comments and refutations with photos and videos showing where they really are. Therefore, we must understand that we are fighting with information, just like the enemy.\"", "Video of a Ukrainian loitering munition strike on a Russian BMP-3. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1667317958756933634?t=TDBs4pBTUsNu3PBTJIQTcA&s=19", "#### Estimated Russian losses from 24.02.2022 to 10.06.2023 (Day 472):\n\nMilestones: 600 MLRS\n\n##### Change since the previous day, day range averages and total all time\n\n|Category|Change|7d|14d|30d|Total|\n|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|Personnel|+890|741.4|604.3|591.3|454.8 (214660)|\n|Tanks|+8|11.4|8.2|5.8|8.3 (3909)|\n|APVs|+7|15.0|11.3|10.4|16.1 (7607)|\n|Artillery|+15|26.3|21.6|21.9|7.9 (3717)|\n|MLRS|+1|2.6|1.9|1.4|1.3 (600)|\n|Anti-aircraft Systems|+3|2.9|2.4|1.7|0.8 (362)|\n|Aircraft|-|0.1|0.1|0.1|0.7 (314)|\n|Helicopters|-|0.1|0.1|0.1|0.6 (299)|\n|UAVs|+16|14.0|19.5|19.6|6.9 (3263)|\n|Missiles|+5|6.3|8.6|5.8|2.5 (1176)|\n|Warships / Boats|-|-|-|-|0.04 (18)|\n|Other Vehicles|+18|19.9|17.5|14.4|13.6 (6428)|\n|Special Equipment|+5|4.6|4.1|3.9|1.1 (507)|\n\n##### Change since the previous day, total losses for day ranges and total all time\n\n|Category|Change|7d|14d|30d|Total|\n|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|Personnel|+890|5190|8460|17740|214660|\n|Tanks|+8|80|115|174|3909|\n|APVs|+7|105|158|313|7607|\n|Artillery|+15|184|303|656|3717|\n|MLRS|+1|18|26|41|600|\n|Anti-aircraft Systems|+3|20|33|52|362|\n|Aircraft|-|1|1|3|314|\n|Helicopters|-|1|1|3|299|\n|UAVs|+16|98|273|587|3263|\n|Missiles|+5|44|120|175|1176|\n|Warships / Boats|-|-|-|-|18|\n|Other Vehicles|+18|139|245|433|6428|\n|Special Equipment|+5|32|58|116|507|\n\nSource: The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine", "New strikes on the Arabat Spit, occupied Kherson region this morning.

The Marshall Islands, where the U.S. dropped more than sixty nuclear weapons between 1946 and 1958, are a particularly notable example. Inhabitants of the Marshall Islands and nearby Guam continue to experience an exceedingly high rate of cancer...\n\n>One of the most recent testaments to the U.S. military's horrendous environmental record is Iraq. U.S. military action there has resulted in the desertification of 90 percent of Iraqi territory, crippling the country's agricultural industry and forcing it to import more than 80 percent of its food. The U.S.' use of depleted uranium in Iraq during the Gulf War also caused a massive environmental burden for Iraqis. In addition, the U.S. military's policy of using open-air burn pits to dispose of waste from the 2003 invasion has caused a surge in cancer among U.S. servicemen and Iraqi civilians alike.\n\n>While the U.S. military's past environmental record suggests that its current policies are not sustainable, this has by no means dissuaded the U.S. military from openly planning future contamination of the environment through misguided waste disposal efforts.

Loran was a teacher in a school in Baku, the center of the Russian oil industry at that time. Impressed by large, difficult-to-extinguish oil fires that he had seen there, Loran tried to find a liquid substance that could deal effectively with them. He invented fire-fighting foam, which was successfully tested in experiments in 1902 and 1903. In 1904 Loran patented his invention, and developed the first foam extinguisher the same year.\n\n>Studies have shown that PFOS is a persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic pollutant. It was added to Annex B of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in May 2009. Regulations in the United States, Canada, European Union, Australia, and Japan have banned the new production of PFOS-based products, including firefighting foams. 3M phased out production of PFOS in 2002 due to toxicity concerns.\n\nJust a guess, but I'm going to say firefighting foam.

Several years later, the foam was traced back to the nearby Marathon refinery, where the company used PFAS-laden foam called class B Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) for emergency response and fire-training, beginning in the 1980s and continuing to 2018.\n\n>One groundwater test at the Marathon property showed PFOS at 765,000 parts per trillion (ppt). And while that number may seem small, it means the groundwater below Marathon is 10,000 times higher than the state\u2019s cleanup criteria of 70 ppt for PFOS in groundwater. Current Michigan standards for drinking water are eight ppt for PFOA and 16 ppt for PFOS, although experts warn that even one ppt could cause negative health impacts.\n\nNow why is the PFAS so high at the Marathon site?

You can\u2019t say oh this is so safe, and then only allow certain counties to be able to take advantage of or control the technology. You can\u2019t say, oh France, you can do Nuclear, but no Iran, you can\u2019t. The solutions we come up with need to be unbiased. Everyone can use Solar, wind, tidal, and many other renewable solutions. Because they aren\u2019t tied to the production of Earth destroying weapons. \n\nNuclear is only safe in a perfect world. Governments come and go, they collapse, wars happen, crazy people take over from sane people. And when that happens, Nuclear can be used to hold the world hostage.

If we actually devoted real resources to renewables we would be there already, but honestly the advancements are happening so quickly, by the time they even design the plans to a new nuclear plant and start building it, other renewables will take over. \n\nThere are whole countries that are now running off renewables. It\u2019s entirely possible to do it and not ever touch Nuclear. And in fact obsessing on Nuclear to be part of the solution is bogging us down.", "See right there that\u2019s a gas light.

It\u2019s honestly archaic. \n\nYou know the whole thing about what\u2019s the definition of insane, doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result. Nuclear hasn\u2019t solved shit. New focuses are Solar, Wind, Tidal.  Those are going to save us, the planet is 70% water we have the ability to build enough wind farms off shore to power our entire planet. Enough energy hits the planet in solar each day to power us 10 times over. Tidal is just getting going. These technologies advancements in the next 5 years will be making nuclear obsolete even before the finish building any new nuclear plants. They are just a huge waste of time, resources, man power, money, and then trying to decommission them\u2026 will take decades. \n\nYou are brainwashed. I don\u2019t know maybe you think your own studies are less obsolete with Nuclear around. I honestly don\u2019t know how all your pro nuclear cult people got so brainwashed about it.

Don't know who or what I'm gaslighting though.\n\n>Transporting solar materials around is not like transporting nuclear waste and nuclear fuel around.\n\nHave there been any noticeable transporting accidents of nuclear material, none that I know of. But I was mostly thinking of the ecological nature of mass mining for something 3 million times less effective.\n\n>You think 70 years is a good indication of how well we can handle Nuclear? 70 years? Seriously?\n\nYes things do very much tend to get safer over time, there is no reason to believe it will suddenly get worse. Again a failure rate less than .07% over 70 years is amazing especially when you have a relatively small top number.\n\n>You are assuming just as much as me about humans ability to to maintain nuclear plants as me assuming inability.\n\nNot how that works, we can both see they are very much working as intended so I'm not assuming anything with a humans ability to maintain them. You on the other hand are assuming things will just suddenly fail.\n\n>Solar/wind/tidal haven\u2019t had an chance to solve it yet they are emerging technologies, ones that have been held down for decades by the oil and coal industry so they could continue to dominate.\n\nAh yes the perpetual claim that these perfect technologies are just really new, despite being invented in the 19th century, and are being held down by the evil oil companies and that's the only reason they're not used.\n\n>Nuclear has been going for long enough, that if it was a solution, it would have solved it by now.\n\nNot how the world works, ever, unfortunately as people are resistant to change especially when people like you clutch your pearls and spread fear about how it's just one small thing away from permanent disaster. Lets just not change anything and really hope a new technology will pop up and solve our issues in time.\n\n>Ukrain has been a complete shit show with the Nuclear plants and come very close to becoming insane catastrophes. It was LUCKY that it hasn\u2019t so far. \n\nIf anything Ukraine has shown how incredibly safe and controllable these plants can be as Zaporizhzhia is still in a controllable state despite the war. Certainly hasn't been a shit show for plants as only 1 has been effected.\n\n>And my point about the Russians digging around in radio active dirt is that yes, they don\u2019t know anything about Nuclear science, but then again, does that mean they can\u2019t go in a fuck with a facility? Cause a meltdown?\n\nThey're stupid, not suicidal first of all. And secondly it's not like you can just slap a couple buttons or toss a grenade on a largely shut down plant and it goes critical, you have to know what you're doing at this point to cause a major issue.\n\n>Most humans and even most politicians have no understanding of Nuclear.\n\nI doubt you do either.\n\n>And those people are making the rules. Honestly humans have just been lucky at this point.\n\nThey don't, nuclear agencies make the rules, and they do understand nuclear. Plus the classic successes wasn't caused by component people, it's just luck that's carried almost everyone somehow. What a perfect line of logic that one, lots of evidence for it.\n\n>Trump wanted to launch a nuclear missile into a hurricane. People around him thought that was a good idea.\n\nBut he didn't so obviously the people who would control that didn't, also not a nuclear plant thing, kinda off point.\n\n>And yes I have family who have toured around many Nuclear facilities.\n\nAnd I have an uncle who works for Nintendo. But if these, very likely made up as no proof exists, family members did see such issues I would really hope they'd have contacted the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\n>Humans man. We absolutely suck at this. We do not have the mental capacity to use Nuclear as a technology.\n\nWe obviously don't and we obviously do, we've been doing it for 70 years. \n\nI swear people like you are so obnoxious, oh humans are the worst we're so dumb and terribly it's only luck were all not dead already, bunch of bullshit said by someone who thinks they're smarter than they really are.

The French government isn\u2019t involved with their nuclear program? Japan? No we just happen to trust those countries to not use the technology for evil, but oh wait\u2026 the US does make weapons with it. So do a lot of countries. Nuclear power is a way for a country to get into the nuclear weapons game, always has been\u2026 but only certain countries are allowed to now\u2026 for damn good reason, but why should any country be trusted with it?

You cannot contain a nuclear catastrophe just to your boarders, so running these plants shouldn\u2019t just be the decision of France. \n\nAnd deaths caused by Nuclear can\u2019t be counted accurately because most of them would be cancer from long term exposure or exposure years earlier. It\u2019s not as simple as, whatever deaths happened in a direct explosion near the facility. So you can\u2019t even confidently speak to that, and the fact you are trying to, tells me all I need to know about your knowledge of it. \n\nOk I\u2019m done with this. Everything you have said has been misrepresenting and miscalculations and downplaying situations. I get you guys are a brainwashed cult, and you will continue to be so.

Nuclear is impossible to do that with. You want it as far away as possible. And the land very well may never be used for anything else ever again. \n\nIt\u2019s sad you actually think that\u2019s a solution.

So when a new technology comes out they can just implement in and keep going. A nuclear plant\u2019s technology is locked in once the design starts.

I'm sure others still keep it as an opinion but just put a lid on it for the moment.

IMO the political coup would be so gratifying to the EU that they'd possibly allow the reversal of brexit.\n\nWhat happens in the EU is that if certain members hold out on something, they usually get brought onside after some horse trading.", "The solution for those parties (whose various contradictory programmes are impossible to usefully implement within the EU without their specific platform being adopted by every single member government simultaneously so they can change the treaties) would be to create a league to dissolve or simultaneously leave the EU and either replace it with a looser trade bloc, or a set of standalone agreements. (perhaps by allowing countries to be members of individual EU components and accept ECJ jurisdiction in relation to those topics only, and regionalising things like rivers management into separate watersheds or excluding landlocked countries from the CFP).\n\nIf there\u2019s multiple countries leaving the EU through the article 50 process, all the others get to be sitting there and voting as part of the EU\u2019s side when negotiating the with other one.

The way to do it is to refuse to accept any change to the EU treaties unless they contained opt-outs or repatriated powers (whether that\u2019s for the whole EU or just the one country). The EU Commission had wanted to have a new round of treaty changes to facilitate further integration back in 2015, and that would have been a perfect time to demand opt-outs. Kerr anticipated that if public opinion was turning against the EU member governments would insist on opt outs or exemptions and so gradually shift out of the EU, or change their minds and re-integrate. What he forgot was that in the UK a simple majority of voters (based on the EEC/EU\u2019s own polls) opposed Maastricht and an absolute majority opposed Lisbon, but the government signed up anyway. (The other irreversible agreement that UK Leavers objected to was the accession of  Poland etc., but I\u2019ve never found opinion polls from between when it was revealed that the migration and economic projections were based on dishonest assumptions (before which it had a small simple majority in favour) until a year after it took effect (by which time it had a larger majority against).)\n\nArticle 50 was mostly there as a way to force Austria out of they elected the wrong party, it\u2019s symbolic value as a guarantee that members could leave was a secondary purpose.", ">EU can't do that, but they can make sure that everyone knows, that if you leave, the consequences will be severe. Not just a temporary slap on the wrist.\n\nThis notion that the EU is 'punishing' the UK is mostly just a Brexiter fantasy used to cover up their own failings, often because they never really understood the EU. The EU is a club with rules. Accept the rules and be in the club. Don't accept the rules, you're not in the club. The Brexiters made bullshit promises that you can make your own rules but still get all the benefits of being in the EU, so now they have to claim they're being 'punished'.

The universe itself - all of space-time - is expanding in every direction. We don't notice on a personal level, because nuclear forces binds atoms together, chemical bonds bind complex molecules together, and gravity binds our planet, solar system, and galaxy together in ways that space seems to be static from our pov. But make no mistake, space is expanding. And it's expanding at a rate that is relativistically faster than the speed of light in a lot of cases. The further away you peer into the universe, the older the image because light travels at a constant velocity. But when space moves around the light, the light can take longer to get to its final destination than the initial distance it was emitted from. This is why we can peer deep into the cosmos and still see stars as they were 13 billion years ago - even though 13 billion years ago the matter that makes up us was a lot closer than 13 billion light years.\n\nSo there will come a time, in the distant future, where the universe keeps expanding so much and to such an extent, that we'll stop being able to observe distant objects that we can see right now. To the degree that only our local cluster of galaxies will ever really be visible from our own perspective. This will be billions of years from now and we won't be here obviously. But at that point, any life that springs into existence looking out into the cosmos won't be able to see what we see. They won't have any evidence that a wider universe exists beyond the Local Cluster because the light coming from those places will never catch up to us because we'll be moving further away than it can travel due to the universe's expansion. Those life forms will come into existence into a dark universe. They'll have no evidence that a Big Bang ever occured, or the true scope and size of the universe. That is knowledge they cannot attain and will never attain, simply based on the circumstance with which they were brought into the world.\n\nSo on a smaller scale, why does our world not work the same?

So once they have put all the time and money into building these nuclear weapons, they will be ready to spend even more money to start decommissioning them. Why not save the money that would be spent building all of those weapons and then spending even more to decommission them, while getting the US and Russia to spend their own money on reducing their arsenals and making them less of a threat in the process? That would seem to serve the goal of getting China to nuclear parity with the US and Russia, but cost a whole lot less.\n\nBesides, if China continues building up its nuclear arsenal, how long until the US, Russia, India, and maybe more start producing more weapons as well to prevent China from catching up or getting ahead of them? Do they really believe that everyone else in the world will not see this as an arms race and just sit back while China builds more nuclear weapons and delivery platforms?

For a long time, the US and Russia were the only ones that mattered, but as they have reduced their stockpiles it becomes more and more important to start including other nuclear powers in the process. While the US might be willing to make a token reduction to start the process off, real denuclearization is something that all nuclear powers will need to participate in.\n\nChina really only has two options: try to out-build Russia and the US to reach nuclear parity with them, or join with the other minor nuclear powers in the world to pressure Russia and the US into reducing their stockpiles to the level everyone else has, and then proceed from there. China is currently pursuing the former path, which both Russia and the US have already figured out is both unsustainable and difficult to return from. The other path can feel less secure, but ultimately saves a ton of resources and gives China a chance to make allies on the world stage by taking their side against both the US and Russia to end Nuclear proliferation rather than contributing to it.

We need to let missile defenses get so good that they can stop all the weapons we have so that Nukes become useless and we can finally let them go. This is not a matter of America versus China, or any nation against any other. This is a matter of humanity against extinction, and it is our duty as human beings who don't want to see our species end to make sure that we push our leaders to stop trying to maintain the ability to end us all, and to build a world where nuclear annihilation is not a threat to anyone.\n\nSorry for the long post, but this is important to me.

Solar and wind have been and are continuing to advance much faster than Nuclear and by the time any plants greenlit now are operational we will not need them. All the pro nuclear arguments fail to look at political climates and fail to see the aftermath of what it does. Which is actually slows us down from working on better renewable projects. \n\nYour thoughts are obsolete, but like the oil and gas industries you will be slow to realize it until it slaps you in the face.

Putting a nuclear power plant close to a city is highly irresponsible, which means you need a lot of country side and a huge buffer between populated areas and even then wind will sweep fallout for 1000\u2019s of miles. \n\nBut here\u2019s a solar farm sitting ontop of a drinking water reservoir, actually benefiting both the solar panels and the reservoir.

With ZERO space being taken up. \n\nSolar and wind isn\u2019t just about energy. It\u2019s about innovative ways to work them into existing programs to make things better. Nuclear is impossible to do that with. You want it as far away as possible. And the land very well may never be used for anything else ever again. \n\nIt\u2019s sad you actually think that\u2019s a solution. There are literally thousands of projects in the works right now for solar and wind and tidal that will come online in the next 5 years and take us way farther than Nuclear ever will.

And they are still putting all of Europe at risk so they can run their plants.\n\nOnly a brainwashed fool would ignore the fact that technology of solar and wind is outpacing Nuclear by a large margin and the advancements can be implemented much quicker as most solar and wind are done in smaller installations with more frequency. So when a new technology comes out they can just implement in and keep going. A nuclear plant\u2019s technology is locked in once the design starts.

Taiwan ended mostly with a Chinese language called Minnan, aka Taiwanese.\n\nIn 1895 (before Cuba was separated from Spain) Taiwan was ceded to Japan by the Qing Empire. Japan wasn\u2019t a perfect ruler but they did bring prosperity, rule of law, infrastructure, and education to Taiwan.\n\n At the end of WWII (1945) Taiwan was handed over to the Chinese Nationalist (KMT) party government of China (officially Republic of China (ROC)). At this point in time the Taiwanese mostly identified as Chinese, although a Taiwanese identity was also growing and there also quite a few people who identified as Japanese. \n\nThe KMT quickly lost a civil war they had been fighting with the communist (CCP) party. The CCP declared their new government the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949.\n\nThe KMT in Taiwan were brutal to the Taiwanese. They tore up the infrastructure to send to the other side of the strait. They suppressed the local culture and forced people to learn a new language. They introduced widespread corruption. In 1947 the 228 massacres occurred and some 20,000 people, including much of the cultural, business and political elite, were killed. The KMT in Taiwan continued to insist that they were the legitimate government of all of China. They put martial law in place that suppressed political rights and resulted in many Taiwanese being imprisoned or killed. \n\nThe KMT and CCP hated each other and had limited contact, but one thing they agreed on was that Taiwan was part of China, the opinions of the Taiwanese people be damned. What the Taiwanese thought of this is not well known because freedom of speech was not respected by the KMT.\n\nIn the 1990s Taiwan became a democracy with human rights and such. It soon became clear that Taiwanese weren\u2019t really on board with the KMT\u2019s Chinese Nationalism.

If they ever achieve this and they find a declaration for a constant like GENDER_PERSON_THINKS_THEY_ARE, then I'll accept gender dysmorphia as an actual real thing.\n\nHowever, that won't happen because it is not.  Male or female, it doesn't matter we're all squishy bags of meat and water, with a little bit of scaffolding thrown in.  The only difference between the sexes is anatomical and the outcomes based on those anatomical differences, i.e. a man doesn't have eggs or a womb, so if he wants to procreate he needs to find a willing female who does, a female doesn't produce sperm, so if she wants to procreate she needs to find a willing male who does.  Outside of procreation, it doesn't matter what is or isn't between one's legs, male or female, we're all the same.  If we live in decent country, we all have the same freedom to pursue whatever our passions may be.\n\nSo tell me, explain to me, existentially, without getting into genetics (XY/XX) or anatomy what is a male and what is a female, what is the difference?  Do go on, humour me with an answer.  Every time I have asked this in the past, not a single soul has even attempted to answer.  Do you know why, because they can't.\n\nMale and female, aside from genetic and anatomical differences, are only further differentiated by constructs of society.\n\nIf a little girl likes tumbling around in the mud, playing with worms etc., if she prefers to hang around with boys and play football, rather than play Disney princess dress-up with the other girls, it simply means that she's a 'tomboy.'  It does not mean that she was born into an the incorrect body, anatomically speaking, and should be thinking about puberty blockers, taking testosterone and one day getting her boobs chopped off!  Her reality is that she is a female, she just gravitates towards activities that society has historically stereotyped as being male activities.\n\nIf a little boy like playing Disney princess dress-up and doesn't care for football, they're just what society would label as 'effeminate.'  Again, certain activities and interests have been stereotyped by the human race as being male or female pursuits.  Nature didn't come up with these societal 'rules.'  Nature didn't create princess dresses and decree that only females should wear them.  Nature didn't invent the sport of football and decree that only males should want to play it.\n\nIf one's interests/passions don't line up with the societal gender stereotypes, it doesn't mean that they were born into a body of the incorrect gender type.  It means that society's gender stereotypes are a load of bollocks and are best ignored, and thankfully this has been changing and continues to do so.  Go back in time a little over one hundred years ago and females serving a front-line military role would be unthinkable.  A man who wanted to get into medicine/healthcare would have to become a doctor, nurses have to be female!  Etc.  The stupid human-derived pigeon holing for genders in the past, is slowly, but surely, being left there - in the past.\n\nJust because a male prefers activities that society has stereotyped as female doesn't mean he needs to get his willy chopped off and silicone implanted in his chest to 'fit in' with society's gender expectations (and vice-versa for a female who prefers male activities).  He or she can pursue whatever interests/passions/activities that they like without denying the reality of their body and without partaking in self-mutilation.\n\nTL;DR - You can't feel like a male or feel like a female, you are your genetics, you are your anatomy.  What a male or what a female 'should' feel like is nothing more than a stereotypical constructs of society.  Seeking to change your gender because it doesn't align with what humans of the past have made-up, what humans have decided should be male or female pursuits, is utter nonsense.  Anyone can do whatever they want, within the realities of their anatomy, societal gender stereotypes don't get to gate-keep certain interests/activities/passions from people.  There's no need for self-delusion and self-mutilation to conform to society's gender expectations before you're allowed to pursue your passions, that's such backward thinking...  and, no, what I'm espousing isn't backward thinking, I'm just seeking to demonstrate the point that you can follow your dreams without denying your biological reality in some vain attempt to try and fit-in/conform with human-created/stereotyped gender standards/constructs.", "[removed]", "you can't appeal to authority by citing a lesser authority than the one you are trying to refute.", "What makes you say NICE is political?", "\u201cA generation of children\u201d??? \n\nHyperbole much?

The reasons for this need to\nbe better understood.\n\nInteresting question there, are kids locked in to the path to transitioning? Or is the vast majority just correctly diagnosed with gender dysphoria? Does that matter if they end up happier? I'd say no, except for that it's very expensive. I hope they are serious about figuring out the reasons, maybe blockers aren't necessary at all and transitioning can happen earlier.\n\nI don't find much about the \"significant risk that could be irreversible\".", "The core concepts here are pretty easy to understand. Before puberty boys and girls have very few significantly different feature sets. Sure, there are the physical genitals, but they're not developed or functional, and of course there are no breasts, wide shoulders, enlarged adams apple, heavy facial bone structure, or all those other differences that separate men and women.\n\nPuberty is where the gross physical changes happen in our bodies, that's where we get the basic structural differences that make it visually easy to distinguish between male and female. \n\nIt's easy to say, \"Let them physically transition when they turn 18\", but that's incredibly ignorant because that completely and totally ignores all of the physical changes that puberty causes in bodies, and once those changes happen they're pretty much irreversible. It's not really possible to rebuild the bone structure of someone's face to change their apparent gender, nor to enlarge or shrink the larynx, or to narrow or widen shoulders and pelvises. It's possible to increase someone's height surgically, but it's an incredibly expensive, painful, and years-long process, and is only really available to those with other defects such as from bad injuries or other medical issue that impaired proper long bone growth.\n\nIn other words, once someone's gone through a puberty that does not match their brain gender their transition options become significantly reduced. For the most part, especially for MtF, they'll always be recognized as having a physical gender different than their presented gender, their brain gender. FtM is somewhat less of a problem because surgical removal of breasts is fairly straight forward, but the person will always appear to be effeminate due to reduced stature, narrow shoulder, slight facial bone structure, high voice, wide hips, etc. \n\nThe thing is, children are smart, after all they're us. They may not have as much learned knowledge, but they're exceptional at figuring stuff out and recognizing patterns. That's a basic human trait, BTW. Brain gender seems to start developing as early as three or four, and typically by 10 the child knows what their gender is. The vast majority of the time that matches their body gender, so going through puberty is just part of normal human development. However, for reasons not yet understood, sometimes a child's brain gender, their internal sense of what they are, does not match their body gender. As they get older and start to learn about gender roles and the way humans interact, they begin to realize that something's not right with them, that they don't fit their body. This is called gender dysphoria, and there are decades of science and research on the subject.  \n\nThere are really only two treatment paths available in these cases, try to brainwash the child into believing that their mental gender matches their body gender, or try to set them up so that they can physically transition as an adult efficiently and effectively such that they don't look like their birth gender in any meaningful way. The first option has already been tried with gay people using \"conversion therapy\", mainly in the religious world. It's been tried for decades. It always fails. After all, if you feel like a man how easy would it be to convince you that you're really a woman? To honestly feel like you're a woman in a man body? It would be impossible, and as such trying to convince trans kids that they're not trans has been an abject failure.\n\nThat leaves just physical treatment, and the key to that is making physical transition possible in a way that's not obvious. That's where puberty blockers come in. All of the treatment for gender dysphoria is purely counseling and therapy before puberty begins, so that's several years. During those years of treatment by a battery of doctors and therapists it become obvious when gender dysphoria is real or \"just a passing phase\". Nobody believes a child can pull off a long-con by spending years convincing trained adult scientists that they're trans, so by the time puberty becomes an issue it's pretty clear what the child's future treatment path will be. Puberty blockers, which have a long and incredibly safe history in children and adults, are used to delay puberty a few short years, long enough for the child's mind to become more mature and to really determine, without a doubt, that transition will be the best path of treatment. \n\nOnce the child turns 15-16 or thereabouts it's really plainly obvious that physical transition is the only real option going forward if  you want to end up with a healthy, living, productive adult who is happy. Only then are the puberty blockers stopped and HRT is prescribed. Mind you, it's been over a decade since the beginning of treatment for the child at this point, treatment by a team of highly qualified doctors and therapists. 15-16 is young enough to change the gender of the puberty since there's another several years of maturing for the body to go through. With HRT the person develops the appropriate physical characteristics of their gender, and when they turn 18 the surgical interventions needed will be fairly minimal. Many trans people elect not to get genital surgery, BTW. The fact that their apparent gender matches their brain gender well enough to not appear trans to others is often enough to let them be mentally and physically healthy adults. \n\nHowever, take puberty blockers out of the treatment plan and all the rest of this is lost. Going through the wrong puberty is a horrific experience for most trans people, especially MtF. For the rest of their lives they'll appear very obviously to be trans, and that'll put them at high risk for being killed, harassed, and discriminated against, both in public and in employment. The options for the rest of their life will be severely limited, and by the time they hit their mid teens and puberty has done most of the damage it will do many of these teens, seeing the bleak future fill with hate for them, will choose to end their lives.", "There was a study where, out of 200 people originally in the sample group, the agency doing the \"gender-affirming care\" had \"lost contact\" with 120 of them.

Personally, I don\u2019t like to argue from a point of authority, it\u2019s often not a good argument to make, but since you\u2019re the one bringing it up. Most STEM is useless in regard to this discussion, exception being biology or pharmacy related studies and even then, it\u2019s such a broad study that people might not necessarily know more than non-STEM about the topic - but most biologists etc will be better in judging the literature and arguments on validity. Medicine often doesn\u2019t require a lot of scientific reasoning unless coupled to a research program, so probably also not best. \n\nYour call for STEM in this discussion tells me you don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re talking about. If the person you\u2019re arguing with had said they did anthropology focussed on the trans community than they would most definitely have known about this.

Current scientific evidence states that gender dysphoria in children should be handled on a case-by-case basis, depending on the type, severely and scope of symptoms and the age they first started manifesting, meaning that in the cases of highest severity an early hormonal transition is acceptable as the last resort while puberty blockers are an acceptable compromise in moderate cases, and *at the very least* (in milder cases or those where the experts are unable to accurately determine whether the child is really trans or not) children should have the option to transition socially (something that doesn't affect their bodies in any way yet transphobes are still passionately against it). From the institutional standpoint, therapy as blanket recommendation is incredibly cheap, easy and simplistic compared to a personalised holistic approach. So why are you still under assumption that this has never been tried before? Forget about children for a moment.

The findings of this are about to be released and he resigned after an advanced read. He hasn\u2019t attended parliament in months though, preferring to make money at speaking engagements. Now there are a series of investigations into the whole COVID management and they want to view the WhatsApp messages between ministers, which will no doubt contain either a) startlingly cynical lack of concern for the plebs, b) prioritising capitalism over healthcare or c) a load of really spicy gossip about each other.", "Everyone\u2019s covered it but yeah, I think there were 14 recorded instances of some sort of party in no. 10 Downing Street during the lockdown, which meant he was breaking the law. \n\nHe was on tv telling people they can\u2019t visit their dying relatives in hospital or care homes etc while he was basically hosting big piss ups in his house. Loud music, suitcases full of booze smuggled in, snacks, champagne. The works. I think one party was very close to the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s death (the late Queen\u2019s husband) so stories of his antics were combined with the photo of her sat alone at her husband\u2019s funeral service to maximise public outrage. \n\nWhen it emerged, he was questioned on it in parliament. He denied that anything happened at first, then when it was clear it happened he denied he knew. When it was clear he knew he said they weren\u2019t parties, just standard office socialising and that he hadn\u2019t broken any (*of his own*) lockdown rules. \n\nAnd the crux is that MPs (including the PM) operate on an honour system called the parliamentary code, and breaking it is typically a resigning offence. Lying in the House of Commons is a key part of this code, it\u2019s one of the big ones. Unfortunately the Prime Minister of the day is the arbiter of said code and decides whether people have broken it or not and he himself simply decided unilaterally that he hadn\u2019t broken it (despite everything mentioned in the previous paragraph). \n\nThat put him on shaky ground and then a couple of months later he did got in hot water about a member of his party being a sexual harasser, and sent other MPs on the news to defend and deny, and ultimately (unknowingly in some cases) lie for him. This led to his party getting rid of him then we had Truss and Sunak. \n\nSince a few months ago a parliamentary committee has been in action, basically an inquiry to get to the bottom of whether he did *intentionally mislead* parliament or not. The committee is cross party, 7 members, 4 of Johnson\u2019s party and 3 of varying opposition parties, headed by an opposition MP (who are appointed by the House of Commons fwiw). The hearing finalised it\u2019s verdict and gave it to Johnson on Thursday. At that point he has a few weeks to appeal the verdict before it goes public. If found guilty he\u2019s suspended from Parliament and this leads to a by-election triggered in his seat. \n\nSo he got this on verdict Thursday, resigned Friday, he jumped before he was pushed.

IMO the political coup would be so gratifying to the EU that they'd possibly allow the reversal of brexit.\n\nWhat happens in the EU is that if certain members hold out on something, they usually get brought onside after some horse trading.", "The solution for those parties (whose various contradictory programmes are impossible to usefully implement within the EU without their specific platform being adopted by every single member government simultaneously so they can change the treaties) would be to create a league to dissolve or simultaneously leave the EU and either replace it with a looser trade bloc, or a set of standalone agreements. (perhaps by allowing countries to be members of individual EU components and accept ECJ jurisdiction in relation to those topics only, and regionalising things like rivers management into separate watersheds or excluding landlocked countries from the CFP).\n\nIf there\u2019s multiple countries leaving the EU through the article 50 process, all the others get to be sitting there and voting as part of the EU\u2019s side when negotiating the with other one.

The way to do it is to refuse to accept any change to the EU treaties unless they contained opt-outs or repatriated powers (whether that\u2019s for the whole EU or just the one country). The EU Commission had wanted to have a new round of treaty changes to facilitate further integration back in 2015, and that would have been a perfect time to demand opt-outs. Kerr anticipated that if public opinion was turning against the EU member governments would insist on opt outs or exemptions and so gradually shift out of the EU, or change their minds and re-integrate. What he forgot was that in the UK a simple majority of voters (based on the EEC/EU\u2019s own polls) opposed Maastricht and an absolute majority opposed Lisbon, but the government signed up anyway. (The other irreversible agreement that UK Leavers objected to was the accession of  Poland etc., but I\u2019ve never found opinion polls from between when it was revealed that the migration and economic projections were based on dishonest assumptions (before which it had a small simple majority in favour) until a year after it took effect (by which time it had a larger majority against).)\n\nArticle 50 was mostly there as a way to force Austria out of they elected the wrong party, it\u2019s symbolic value as a guarantee that members could leave was a secondary purpose.", ">EU can't do that, but they can make sure that everyone knows, that if you leave, the consequences will be severe. Not just a temporary slap on the wrist.\n\nThis notion that the EU is 'punishing' the UK is mostly just a Brexiter fantasy used to cover up their own failings, often because they never really understood the EU. The EU is a club with rules. Accept the rules and be in the club. Don't accept the rules, you're not in the club. The Brexiters made bullshit promises that you can make your own rules but still get all the benefits of being in the EU, so now they have to claim they're being 'punished'.

You're almost making it sound like it's a protection racket... I'm about as anti-brexit as a person can be but if what you're saying holds any water then perhaps the EU really needs to examine how it operates.", "They don't have to make a point that if you leave the consequences will be severe, the UK did that for them.

Their response will typically involve the cost they incur from the distributor, as well as expenses like electricity, water, labor, taxes, and profit. Proceed to question the distributor about the reasons behind their pricing for the retailer. Similarly, engage with the electric company to understand their basis for charging a particular amount. The distributor may explain that their pricing encompasses fuel and transportation costs, as well as other expenses, taxes, and profit. This process can be continued until reaching the core of each sector involved, including the cultivation or extraction of the actual raw resources, even tracing back to the oil extracted and processed for fuel in the transportation sector. By doing so, it becomes possible to identify the specific entity responsible for the excessive charges that led to this entire predicament.\n\nI believe that the primary underlying factor is the prices of oil, which influences the entire food production process. There is another expense that follows the entire process. Taxes. Excessive taxation affects multiple stages of food production, encompassing sales, property, payroll, unemployment, social security, medicare, utility, excise, fuel, import/export, property transfer, wholesale, distribution, environmental, local, Special Agricultural Levies, conservation, customs duties, equipment and machinery taxes, as well as business taxes. Additionally, there are requirements for business licenses, vehicle registration fees and taxes, and a multitude of taxes and fees imposed by the government on farming, distribution, import/export, and food sales.\n\nEDIT: Also corporate board member bonuses, million-dollar executive salaries, and stock buybacks.

This goes from luxury items like boats and RVs, to everyday life necessities like food and housing. This ensures the seller maximizes their profit, regardless of the interest rate.

The French Revolution, Luddites (who were somewhat misconstrued), Marx and more modern variations on Marxism, trade unions, the Berlin Wall, Solidarity, the gloomy disappointing monotony of nationalized industries, Sweden (again more complex and less utopian than popularly believed), squatters, shoplifters, Robin Hood, and idealistic people who go off to live on communes and typically regret it after a year or so.\n\nI also think about May Day riots and habitual protesters against anything that's going, because that mindset seems to be associated with socialism. My parents brought me out on some protest march and gave me a placard to hold, before I was old enough to read it.

My general impression is that these people belong to the last category, that is, that they would like to live in communes except not actually. Of course that may be a conflation of socialism with communism. Other people talk about Universal Basic Income, which is attractive sounding but sketchy, and the general idea of public services and taxing the rich, which I think even within a generally market-friendly political atmosphere can still be called *socialistic* at least.\n\nThen there's market *regulation*. That ought to be part of capitalism, to prevent it being mere exploitation: on the other hand, it's less a part of free market capitalism, which tends to argue for light regulation. Evidently the rule of law is an essential for capitalism, at least - otherwise it would merely be a bunch of warlords robbing from one another.

We had a home computer from 1991. We had three TVs at home so I always had a screen I could watch if I wanted. We had cable/satellite so I had dozens of kids channels.

He writes his own emails to his grandparents, etc. He can research subjects he is interested in. He writes stories and draws pictures on the computer. Recently he started keeping a daily journal which he loves to look back at and tell us stories of things from months ago. I don't consider any of these things bad use of screens. Quite the opposite tbh.\n\nBut who knows perhaps I am the wrong one but in my mind teaching a child how to productively use the tools in the world is important. I don't want him to turn 13 and suddenly have unlimited screen time (which is basically what the French guidelines are as there are no restrictions from 13!) with tablets, phones, computers, consoles, etc. I want him to know how to use them for both fun and serious work.\n\nAs I said I 100% agree with some limits and to teach children to use these tools properly.

Do you only let them use things for study and homework? \n\nDo you think that limiting their use before 13 and then them having unlimited use at 13 helps or hinders the situation with online bullying, depression and suicide? \n\nWe have different opinions on this obviously and that is great because I don't think there is a clear, single solution to the situation.

The city was under siege, and prices for essential goods such as food rose sharply.  The government imposed price controls, set at what food used to cost. Traders did not feel this compensated them for the risk of bringing food into a city under siege and stopped supplying the city. The city soon fell due to famine.\n\nFor a more recent example, look at why Venezuela was starving.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/transcripts/705259623\n\nGARCIA: Guillermo Arcay, an economist based in Caracas at Ecoanalitica - that's an economic research firm - says that Venezuela's farming companies back then could choose which kinds of food they wanted to produce, and they could sell that food at the market price. But, says Guillermo...\n\nGUILLERMO ARCAY: That's something that started to change when Chavez started implementing what he called socialism of the 21st century policies.\n\nZUNIGA: Guillermo is referring to Hugo Chavez, Venezuelan late president. There were several agricultural policies that Chavez put in place. The first policy was price controls. That started in 2003.\n\nGARCIA: Yeah. And price controls are exactly what they sound like. The government forces companies to sell their products below a certain price. The price is controlled. It is capped.\n\nSo in this case, back in 2003, the Hugo Chavez government started capping the price of food. Supermarkets could not charge people more than a certain amount for the food that they bought from them. It started with basic foods, like sugar and milk. And the goal was to make food cheaper for Venezuelans. But there is a reason that price controls are considered bad economics.\n\nZUNIGA: Here is why. The supermarkets still had to buy the food from the farming companies. And if the supermarkets cannot sell the food for more money than they buy it, then the supermarkets don't have an incentive to buy as much food to put on their shelves, right? So the result is that less food starts showing up in the supermarkets.\n\nGARCIA: And so, as Guillermo explains, the government then just extended the price controls to the farming companies themselves. The government forced the farmers to sell their food for below the market value to the supermarkets.\n\nARCAY: It started with the price of the final good. But afterwards, they started implementing price caps on all of the supply chain.\n\nGARCIA: So the farmers now could not sell their food to the supermarkets for the market value. So they, the farmers, did not have an incentive to make as much food. And they stopped investing in the equipment and fertilizer and other things needed to make the food. And they did, indeed, start making less food.\n\n\n\nA more recent example (not related to the government) was price controls by supermarkets on farmers in UK. They only paid a fixed price to farmers for produce, which did not compensate them for the rising energy prices last year. This made it unprofitable to grow food, which meant of course they stopped growing food, leading to massive food shortages in UK which were not present in Europe, which allowed food prices to rise with energy prices.", "Ah, you changed your comment quite a bit after I replied to it.

The most terrible but inevitable losses are people. And unfortunately, military equipment that cannot be destroyed has not yet been created. But today's wars take place in two dimensions - real and informational. Information battles are no less fierce. And they also have certain tasks, rules and laws. For example, any party to an armed conflict seeks to show the enemy's losses and classifies its losses during the active phase of hostilities. Why? Because the more information about the enemy is publicly available, the easier it is to calculate their capabilities and plans. In addition to intelligence, which is now very difficult for the Russians on our territory, there are other ways to extract the necessary information by throwing provocations into the information space. In this way, you can force the other side to give out as much information about itself as possible. For example, by encouraging justifications and refutations. To do this, very inflated figures are thrown at us in the expectation that we will indignantly begin to refute and give out some data or indirect references to them. Or, for example, information about the disappearance of the Commander-in-Chief or other commanders is being thrown around, expecting comments and refutations with photos and videos showing where they really are. Therefore, we must understand that we are fighting with information, just like the enemy.\"", "Video of a Ukrainian loitering munition strike on a Russian BMP-3. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1667317958756933634?t=TDBs4pBTUsNu3PBTJIQTcA&s=19", "New strikes on the Arabat Spit, occupied Kherson region this morning.

There is truth to this, in that the independence of Taiwan has been held by the threat of conflict with the US and the west in general, and the question of whether US military support is a bluff or not is being proven out by the stolidity of our support for Ukraine.\n\nBut . . . The invasion of Taiwan would be very very different in so many ways from the present war. And a lot of those key differences seem to be missed. I'd like to lay them all out.\n\nFirst the things that make the invasion of Taiwan *easier* than an invasion of Ukraine:\n\n1. **Taiwan is a lot less populous and a looooot smaller then Ukraine.** Even a successful military campaign in Ukraine was doomed to eventual failure because the Russian military lacked the capability to *hold* Ukraine in the long term. This should have been a deterrent, except that Putin is an idiot. In any case, China does not lack that capability.\n\n2. **The Russian military was not designed with campaigns like the present one in mind, whereas the Chinese PLA was very much designed for this exact scenario.** The core capabilities the Russian Armed Forces were designed for was defense of their own soil, and limited projection of power. They wanted to be able to deter invasion of the homeland, while being able to influence events abroad like in Syria. The Ukraine campaign didn't look like either of those and that's a significant reason that the initial invasion looked so slapdash. Russia was fighting in ways it was not designed to fight, and required capabilities that it simply lacked on a large scale. The Chinese Military has spent decades modernizing its army with a view on the capabilities needed to invade Taiwan.\n\n3. **Taiwan does not have as deeply rooted a national identity as Ukraine.** Which is not to say Taiwan doesn't have a national identity of it's own, simply that it is different. While Russia has occupied Ukraine for much of the last 200 years, there is a much longer history of political and cultural separation before that. The Russian and Ukrainian languages diverged 1500 years ago (by Ethnologue's lexical similarity index, they are about as similar to each other as English and Spanish.) Putin saw Ukrainians as fundamentally Russian and thought they would be apathetic at the prospect of rule from Moscow instead of Kiev. That was a deep misunderstanding of the Ukrainian identity. Taiwan's identity is more nuanced. Most of modern Taiwan does not descend culturally or genetically from the native population of the island, but from mainland settlers that arrived within the last three centuries (and mostly within the last 75 years.) 85% speak Mandarin that is completely intelligible with the mainland dialects. Taiwan has a strong and unique political identity, but it doesn't see itself as ethnically distinct. I do not know how hard they would ultimately resist, but I would caution that we cannot use Ukraine as a model here.\n\nAnd now, things that make an invasion of Taiwan *harder*:\n\n1. **Amphibious landings are hard.** I don't think I need to sell you on this. There are no natural defenses between Russia and Ukraine. Taiwan has the best kind of natural defense there is.\n\n2. **China is a net importer of food and fuel.** I think this is the most important difference, and one I haven't really seen discussed. Economic sanctions at their heart are just reductions in trade; modern economies depend on trade, and the more you cut off, the more it will hurt that economy. But what kind of trade you are actually cutting makes a big difference in the timeline of the pain. Russia is a huge exporter of food and energy; their economy has been battered by sanctions, and the impacts will only compound over time, but as we have seen that timeline is measured in years. China is an importer of both fuel and food, and they need sea lanes for those imports. An economic war with China would be incredibly painful for the economy of the US (and for everyone, China is a muuuuch bigger economy than Russia) but China is far more vulnerable to sanctions or embargo than Russia. The timeline on which a reduction in international trade would start to really hurt China would be significantly shorter.\n\nAnd finally some unknowns:\n\n1. **How ready is the Chinese military?** For all their modernization efforts, China is completely untested. How well trained are their troops? How flexible is their leadership? How bad is corruption? These are things that are basically impossible to know until the rubber meets the road. Russia actually was a pretty well-tested military, and no one knew how bad things had gotten until the going got tough in Ukraine.\n\n2. **How will the US actually react?** Direct war? Strong embargo? Weak sanctions? Taiwan is much more directly important to US interests than Ukraine ever was. There is reason that the US has been so vocal that they will stand up for Taiwan (where they didn't really for Ukraine). But if China actually goes for it, does the US really go to war with China? Nobody knows.\n\n3. **How will Taiwanese defenses hold?** The US is really far away and China's really close. Even if the US means it that they will go to war over the defense of Taiwan, the Taiwanese need to hold off the PLA on their own for days before the US could make a show of force. Just like how crucial the first few hours of the defense of Kiev were, the first 72 hours of this invasion would completely change the shape of the conflict. The US Navy, with its trillions of dollars of budget, doesn't mean a thing if Taiwan can't hold long enough for them to get there in force.", "[deleted]", "Silly question.

It produces 60% of global semiconductors and 90% of the advanced ones. Yes, its one of those things you don't believe you haven't hear of before you do, but if Taiwan got hit by an asteroid, you wouldn't be able to buy anything electronic for a decade.\n\nThe government explicitly places semiconductor factories where an invading army would have to destroy them in order to conquer Taiwan. Semiconductor factories are incredibly fragile, so any idea of a fast war and getting them back online in a few months is out of the question.\n\n2) This has already been partially addressed, but the problem with amphibious landings isn't just the landing part. There are miles of open sea between Taiwan and China, and sinking 10 000 enemy troops in ships using missiles, bombs or torpedoes is much more trivial than destroying 10 000 troops dispersed trough mountains and forests, invisible to radar, moving a few hundred feet every day. If Chinese transport ships appear on the horizon, Taiwan isn't flying old Soviet airplanes to bomb them.\n\n3) Taiwan is fully trained to use modern and plentiful western equipment. One of the huge bottleneck's both early in the war and even now is that there are thousands of tanks, artillery, drones, helicopters and airplanes countries might want to send to Ukraine, but nobody in Ukraine would be able to actually operate them. Taiwan can be given more weapons by the west from day 1.\n\n4) The Taiwanese government and people are much more prepared than Ukraine was. The internet loves to call Putin an idiot for going to war with Ukraine, but it did actually work great for Putin the first time. He did a lightning fast operation, took Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk and got away with it. Taiwan is more unified and its government is better prepared for a Chinese first strike.\n\n5) A minor point, but Taiwan has made an big effort to attract human rights and humanitarian organizations and have them put their headquarters in Taiwan. Any Chinese invasions would be additionally diplomatically damaging and play badly in the global media.\n\n6) There are good reasons to believe than Japan (the 3rd largest economy) would react much more severely to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan than the EU was thought it would react to a Russian invasion of Ukraine.", "There were and are Taiwanese before Changs gang showed up and they will absolutely fight for Taiwan.", "Very interesting read but doesn't really fit in this thread about Ukraine", "Now I have a legit question.

This makes them orders of magnitude more similar than English and Spanish.\n\nTrue. I didn't want to go into too much detail on this small point, but it merits some explanation. Having descended from a common language isn't the only reason languages can be similar. Ethnologue's lexical similarity index (ELSI) is based entirely on how many words for the same thing are similar in two languages. English gets over half its vocabulary from French due to the Norman invasions, hence English has a lot of cognates with Romance languages. The ELSI is not perfect but it is a good shorthand for how mutually intelligible two languages are. There is a belief on the internet (encouraged by Russian nationalism) that Russian and Ukrainian are basically the same language with a high degree of mutual intelligibility, and my point was just that no, they're in practice about as similar as English and Spanish.\n\nOf course, most Ukrainians do speak Russian (less so in the west of the country), but as you said, language and culture are not the same.\n\nMy larger point about the Russian and Ukrainian languages being quite different was not that language and culture and identity are the same thing. They're not. But language differences come from long periods of isolation, and I wanted to illustrate the length of isolation that forged a separate Ukrainian identity (1500 years), in comparison with the very short isolation of Taiwan (75 years), which speaks a completely intelligible language to mainland China.", "Yes, completely intelligible, as in it can be easily understood by a speaker of mainland mandarin. That's what I was saying.\n\nAnd the intelligibility of the language is not the point in itself. The point was to compare the process that forged the Ukrainian identity to that which forged the Taiwanese identity. The same 1500 years of separation that caused their languages to diverge forged a separate Ukrainian identity that sees itself as ethnically and culturally distinct from Russians. Whereas divergence between Taiwanese and mainland Mandarin are products of the last 75 years, because so much of the population of modern Taiwan left mainland China in the 40s and 50s.", "Another big difference is that it's relatively easy to resupply Ukraine with whatever they need.  Taiwan could be almost entirely cut off from the rest of the world if China were able to make it too risky for cargo ships to land.\n\nPossibly they could be resupplied by air, but that's very expensive and the amount of cargo you can move that way is limited.\n\n(edit: I meant to reply to parent comment, not yours.  Oh well.)", "Not just US v China, but Taiwan, US, Australia, Japan v China.  If things start going badly  for China then other allies join.\n\nI have no idea the feelings of patriotism and the passion for keeping the polity separate in Taiwan (one assumes it would spike at invasion), but I wonder the mechanisms in place keeping Taiwan from acquiring undeclared tactical nuclear capability specific to defending the straight and littoral waters from invasion.\n\nIt the above is high and the resolve of the US/Japan/Australia low in, I imagine the temptation to get weapons that can make a crossing of the Taiwan Strait impossible become very appealing.", "Wendy's now serving double bacon military theory.", "1) Big agree\n\n2) Big agree\n\n3) Agree, but with the caveat that I have read many reports that stress grumblings of low readiness in the Taiwanese armed forces.

Between 2014 and 2022 there was a complete transformation of the Ukrainian military. I don't know how Taiwan's present preparedness compares to Ukraine before Feb 2022. I certainly wouldn't feel confident with the assertion that Taiwan is more ready.\n\n5) Sure, but I don't really know that China cares about this.\n\n6) I don't think Japan is joining the war. I'm sure they will work feverishly on Taiwan's behalf, but I don't think that their impact will be a gamechanger. I think that so much of this campaign would hinge on whether the US attempts to blockade Chinese shipping, which they would want Japanese support with, but ultimately without outright entering the invasion, Japan's role will be support.", "You cant take land without actually taking it. Also the fact that China relies on food and energy imports to function, those would be cut off in an open war, plus the massive economic damage from exports getting shut off.

Out of the four \u201cnew territories,\u201d he was the most high profile because he was largely respected by the regional population pre-invasion.  Of course, everyone considered him a traitor afterwards.  But essentially, Russia liked him bc he had clout and was amiable to their demands.\n\nBc he was a collaborator, he immediately became a target, and the GRU started protecting him.  He thus began to trust the GRU (Russian military intelligence), and regarding the financial coffers of Kherson\u2014municipal funds, pensions, state accounts, pharmacy funds, contract funds, etc.\u2014he allowed the access to be guarded by the GRU rather than the FSB.  This angered the FSB, who see themselves as superior, and when the FSB was unsuccessful in getting any of the traitors-deputies to turn their allegiance towards them and give them access, they poisoned Saldo.  It ended up being a *very* big deal\u2014he was flown to Moscow, extensive tests and treatments were performed, and it came to light he was poisoned by the FSB, the FSB regional command was pulled\u2014that episode was a contributing factor spurring Gerasimov to seek and gain permission to withdraw from the Right Bank of Kherson, entirely. \n\nSaldo stayed in Russia for months, recuperating, and the fake-administration moved to Genichesk, the southern tip of Kherson Oblast, where the various collaborators have continued to be successfully targeted.  Saldo eventually moved to Crimea, the Russians still considered him the \u201chead\u201d of the \u201cnew territory.\u201d  He\u2019s on the Russian-controlled regional television, often, and his statements are regularly published as the local authority bc he\u2019s considered the \u201cgovernor.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been the target of Atesh^* for many, many months.
