The passing glance between her now ex-lover and a woman hanging around his shared-house spontaneously convinced her there must be some kind of twisted romantic entanglement between them.

She couldn\u2019t understand what she was doing back in the middle-of-nowhere town she moved to years ago in order to escape the trauma of her romantic life, the same place she ran away from as fast as she could after living with her layabout ex for nearly three long and suffocating years.

During their time together, he had learned how others express themselves with all the senses, with the semi-concealed vocabulary of the unconscious: with the soft touch and tender looks and the fragrance that covers the air shared between lovers, things that nobody else can smell or touch or see, the things that create a silent understanding of the waves of affection that pushes one body towards another. The only ones that can develop the skills to see such a language spoken amongst others are the scorned and jealous lovers, though their wild paranoia - their constant state of alert for signs of betrayal - often leads them to realms of pure fantasy, to the transformation of the world into a theater of their desires.", "id": "1430wf2", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortSadStories/comments/1430wf2/on_returning/", "created_utc": 1686105201.0, "score": 6, "permalink": "/r/ShortSadStories/comments/1430wf2/on_returning/", "comments": [], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "Cold", "selftext": "The cold metal against his tongue bothered him more than it should have.\n\nWhat did it matter?\n\nWhy did he care?\n\nIt was all going to be over soon anyway.\n\nThe gun was loaded and ready to be used.\n\nSo why was the coldness of the metal from the barrel all he could think about?\n\nHe took the gun out of his mouth and looked at the barrel.\n\nIt was a deep shade of black.

The name of the rooster is Cockadoodle.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nThe mayor, a portly man in his late fifties, is sitting at his desk looking worried. A young reporter, JENNY, is interviewing him.\n\nJENNY\nWhat's going on in this town, mayor?\n\nMAYOR\n(looking worried)\nIt's that damn rooster, Cockadoodle.

Our story begins with a boy who fell in love. It was his first true love, and he would have done anything she asked. They would go on picnics and would watch movies together. They enjoyed being together. But not all stories have a happy ending. Even though they loved each other very much he lost her to Death's cold touch. He spent months trying to think of a reason why she did this to him and no matter what he thought he didn't have answers he didn't have closure. This bothered him greatly because he blamed himself for years he couldn't see past the pain and hatred. Until one day he picked up a bow and started to learn archery. This brought him some peace, but it wasn't enough he needed to know why. Why or how could she do this to him? No matter what he did it was there following him. His hatred grew resentment for love. The one person he truly trusted is gone and he was left alone, and he cut himself off from the world. Living in solitude helped but it was still like a whisper in his ear, her voice calling him. He is suffering for what he has done. He doesn\u2019t understand why. Every day he asks himself the question and tries to find a reason but there doesn't seem to be one. He is confused, lost, maybe sad or angry but one thing he understands is everyone deserves a chance. He tries his best to treat everyone kindly but he doesn't think he deserves it so he can\u2019t let go of his hatred for himself. One day he can be with her, but that day is a long time away. Some would call this a form of survivor guilt; he is not so sure. Love is a truly strong bond it has been years now, but he still feels the same.

I want to tell you about seeing Saturn\u2019s rings, how the Milky Way glimmers, how beautiful the stars shine when they aren\u2019t obscured by city light pollution.\n\nBut I can\u2019t.\n\nShortly after passing the asteroid belt, the computer systems woke me out of my cryopod to investigate a system error.  Looking through the logs, I found a tragedy in action.\n\nThe refrigeration systems have broken, allowing a large portion of our food and scientific supplies to go bad.  I then made the realization that there\u2019s been another issue.  The supplies we\u2019ve brought are woefully inadequate, about a third of what they should be.  The numbers in the logs stated that there should be enough oxygen and equipment for where we\u2019re supposed to go, but that doesn\u2019t match with what we have.\n\nI looked at the numbers again and compared that against what we have in the cargo hold, and I figured out the error.  The time for the duration of our mission, outside of cryosleep, had been mistaken with the supply numbers.\n\nThis is an impending disaster that we cannot survive even if we reach our destination and use our resources sparingly.  We\u2019re too far out to return to Earth to get more supplies; the very same issue that would leave us in dire straits at our destination means we don\u2019t have enough to turn back.\n\nI suppose an \u2018obvious\u2019 solution would be to keep one person conscious to return the ship, but we\u2019re already light years away.  It isn\u2019t possible to man the ship without the computers taking over a large portion of the journey, and the computers have already demonstrated other system failures that led to this current issue.\n\nAs the lone officer presently available, I\u2019ve made the executive decision to begin the process to put the crew to permanent sleep.  They don\u2019t need to know that the mission is doomed; that would cause more panic than is necessary.  We can\u2019t change the outcome, only the means.\n\nThis is a burden I didn\u2019t anticipate when joining the crew.\n\nBut even now, as I write this, I don\u2019t want to die.  I want to live!  I wanted to see the galaxy and advance us for space travel!  Even if the travel in sci-fi shows wouldn\u2019t be possible in my lifetime, I wanted to help make it happen.\n\nAnd I feel so, crushingly alone.\n\nBut a way, looking out the window is a cold comfort.  I can see the stars as I pass, and I keep thinking my mother teaching me about constellations as a kid.

Teares streaming down her face in a unique pattern, similar to the patters of the rain that comforted me earlier.

My visioned blurred once again, as my emotions took over. A rich slaty taer tiptoes down my left cheek in unison with my mothers.

The bamboo in our garden kept the sun out of the window. All the light in the room was from our television, which was blasting a speech. Somehow, I had this deep feeling that we were in trouble just from how the man spoke. For the first time in months, I began to cry, staining the collar of my bright pink shirt.\n\nWhen I was nine, I started to learn English. My mother, Li Fen, married an American soldier named David. He had learned Chinese on an app to impress her in high school, and it paid off. Now, he was the teacher. It was hard to wrap my head around all the conjugations and sentence structures at first. But my mom helped me by telling me to think of everything in smells. This method somehow made sense to my young brain, and by eleven, I was fluent enough to impress even my elementary school teachers.\n\nAt sixteen, I started training to join the military just like my dad. During my academy days, I saw multiple videos from our president Chen Haiwei. I had learned he was the man I saw on TV eleven years ago. He warned us all of our undertaking, but I pressed through, even as I watched others drop out. At age eighteen, I got sent off to war. For all I know now, my fellow army men could\u2019ve been the last people I ever saw alive.\n\nTen years later, my town was erased. An army of gold-helmeted soldiers ransacked our town, and my parents were some of the lucky few to escape. As I stood there, watching my town burn and my friends put it out, my mind went back into smells for the first time in decades.\n\nSmoke, like old wood.\n\nBlood, like that one sauce we put on our rice.\n\nDeath, like rotten apples.\n\nAs time passed, I slowly forgot my town\u2019s name.

One story I remember, about Joey Evanston, is when he saved the school's musical from ending in chaos by climbing to the top of the auditorium and fixing the speakers in less than ten minutes. \n\nJoey Evanston was nice, and that was easy for people to prey on. In high school, there's always someone who's guaranteed to be an asshole. Brian Cavonia would go out of his way to push Joey Evanston or make fun of Joey Evanston's mom for her cancer, or mess up his projects, but Joey Evanston still kept a smile plastered on his face.

One story I remember, about Joey Evanston, is when Brian Cavonia tripped him down a flight of stairs, and he broke his leg, yet Joey Evanston didn't snitch. \n\nJoey Evanston was nice, and that made Joey Evanston seem happy. In high school, there's plenty of problems people have, and Joey Evanston had a mental one. Joey Evanston's mom died a week before it happened. Joey Evanston started blowing off his classes. Joey Evanston seemed completely fine. Joey Evanston is the type of guy who seemed completely fine. One time I remember, Joey Evanston broke down in class the day before it happened, he ran out of the class to the bathroom. The teacher continued the lecture, and nobody checked on him. I could've checked on him. \n\nA month ago today, at 12:22 PM, Joey Evanston got on top of a lunch table and just started screaming at random people. At 12:23 PM, Joey Evanston pulled out an M9 Beretta his dad used while on his deployment. People ran out of the cafeteria, hid under tables, called the police, and filmed Joey Evanston. Approximately forty-two cameras were on Joey Evanston when he put the gun against his head. I was frozen at my lunch table, staring upward at Joey Evanston. The screaming and panic had stopped, it was completely silent except for the breathing of the students in the cafeteria. \n\nJoey Evanston looked down at me, from atop my lunch table, and told me four words. \n\n\"This isn't your fault.\" \n\nJoey Evanston shot himself in the head at 12:25 PM. A piece of his scalp made its way into my lap, his blood splattered against me, other students, tables, the floor. The floor was red, completely red. Pieces of Joey Evanston's brain were in my hair, on my shirt, everywhere. A quarter of Joey Evanston's head was gone. Joey Evanston's body fell off the table, the gun still in his hand as he lay on the floor. \n\nJoey Evanston was quiet, and the lunchroom was too, until Heather Ophelia screamed. Then more people screamed, more running, and more fear. Fear. Fear had frozen me in place, I sat with a soda can in hand, holding on to the tables bench, next to Joey Evanston's body, drenched in blood. The police had to drag me away from the scene, attempting to console me as they did. \n\nA week later, school was back in session, and I had to sit at the same table I sat at when Joey Evanston put a bullet in his own head. I sat in my seat, and Brian Cavonia sat on the school's roof. Brian Cavonia wore his signature letterman jacket, previously stained with blood from Joey Evanston, now drenched in his own. Brian Cavonia's body was found by the school's janitor, Mr. Victor. Brian Cavonia was face down, on top of the principals now crushed car. Mr. Victor quit the next day. \n\nA week later, Mr. Evanston, Joey's dad refilled his bottle of painkillers at the local pharmacy. People at the pharmacy said their condolences, and Mr. Evanston accepted them, like he had done when his wife had died. Mr. Evanston was a soldier; he'd made it through war. He'd made it through his wife\u2019s death, with his son. Mr. Evanston had nothing left when Joey Evanston killed himself in the middle of the school cafeteria.

That's when I realized that Joey Evanston might've been nice to other people, but people weren't nice back to him, I was, though. I was Joey Evanston's only friend.

He barely felt the ribs crack as the Jack Russel went tumbling along the freshly-mown grass. There was a faint whimper like the air being blown out of a tyre; and it lay still. In one hand he quick-dialled the pizza joint at the end of the street, having decided on his usual. Pepperoni, garlic bread and a nice big bottle of cola to chase it down. With his free hand he grabbed the pup by the neck and lifted it into the air like he would a bit of plastic or a stray leaf. He liked to keep his lawn pristine at all times. I\u2019ll have to clean that up, he thought irritably as he noticed a deep spot of blood on his Kentucky Bluegrass.\n\u2018Kevin\u2019s pizza, what can I do for you?\u2019 He\u2019d almost forgotten about lunch.\n\u2018It\u2019s Alex, I want the usual. And hurry up about it.\u2019 He hung up even before they could respond. After tucking the phone back in its breast pocket, alongside a small notebook and a singular pen, he turned back to the dog. The name tag read: MAX. Before he could comment how stupid a name that was there was a scream and he turned to a see woman howling hysterically across the street. He recalled now that Max belonged to this woman. What\u2019s she crying about, he thought. The sign on the gate clearly states: PRIVATE PROPERTY. At least he wouldn\u2019t have to dispose of it now.\nAlex stepped out of his yard and onto the street toward the woman. She backed away, fumbling with something in her handbag. \u2018I\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u2019 he said. And he meant it. \u2018You haven\u2019t been on my Kentucky bluegrass.\u2019 A car horn blasted, and a second later Alexander Pierce\u2019s body was thrown fifty feet into the air like a stuffed toy that\u2019s just been kicked across the room. When his body landed back on the tarmac his soul was already on its way.\n***\n\u2018Hello,\u2019 the angel said. \u2018Have a seat.\u2019 Alex looked around and saw with astonishment that he sat opposite three virgin figures. He tried to stand but found he couldn\u2019t.\n\u2018Where am I?\u2019 He asked.\n\u2018Heaven,\u2019 the middle one replied. \u2018Now can we please begin the interview? We have plenty more to get through today.\u2019 Their voices were identical and as plain as the table at which they sat. Over their shoulder Alex saw two sets of stairs, one leading up, and the other down. Without waiting for a reply, the rightmost angel began. \u2018Tell us about yourself.\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 Alex said nervously. He\u2019d never done an interview before, although he vaguely knew how they worked. \u2018I love my Kentucky Bluegrass. It\u2019s summer right now, so it needs extra love and attention and,\u2019 he added, \u2018I was about to clean it before all this.\u2019 The angel jotted something down.\nIt was the centre angels turn now. \u2018Describe yourself in three words.\u2019 Suddenly he remembered an episode from his favourite sitcom. He watched it only a few months ago, and he quickly recited the dialogue back to the angel with the same straight face he always wore. \u2018Hard-work, diligence and integrity,\u2019 he said confidently. If this worked like it did in the movies, he\u2019d be laughing all the way to the bank. He thought he might even be enjoying himself. Each time a new question came, and he had a ready-made answer to sling back at them he grew more surprised, and more relaxed. \u2018What\u2019s your biggest weakness?\u2019\n\u2018I try too hard.\u2019\nA pause. Some more writing. A new angel now.\n\u2018Tell us about a time you went above and beyond.\u2019 They were getting harder now, but he was in the swing of things. It was like he was an actor in his very own sitcom.\n\n\u2018In the spring of 98,\u2019 Alex said, \u2018A drought swept across our great nation. All my neighbours huddled in the cool of their suburban homes while I mended to my Kentucky grass. And by the end of the drought, I had the greenest lawn on the entire southern coast. Ask anyone.\u2019\nMore writing.\n\u2018One last thing,\u2019 the angel who first spoke said. \u2018Do you believe in Jesus Christ?\u2019\n\u2018Why yes of course,\u2019 Alex replied without hesitation. He was lying through his teeth. \u2018Honest to god,\u2019 he added. \u2018Cross my heart and hope to die.\u2019\n\u2018Very well,\u2019 the angel said, \u2018Up the stairs and to the right.

Nothing I do feels right. No matter how hard I try, looming over me casting a great uncomfortable shadow, is this uncanny feeling of wrongness about everything I do. Every move I make is mocked and questioned, every thought is ridiculed and cast down for being useless, unimportant, stupid. Shrouded beneath the watchful gaze of this malign presence, I can do nothing but buckle under its weight and collapse in on myself. \n\nI am screaming inside, begging to be let out, but there is nowhere for me to go. All this pent-up angst churns my organs, curdling them like sour milk, rotting me from inside. The rot spreads, infecting not only projections of the future but also muddying glimpses of the past. Memories that were once happy are now filtered through this murky lens, twisted and broken, now sick perversions of what once was. I am sick to look in any direction, be it forward or back, through my life for fear of what I might see.  \n\nI need to get out, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m suffocating as the walls of reality close in all around me. Trapped in my own skin, there is nowhere I can run to be freed of this torment. Being a prisoner of your own mind is as deep a torment as one can experience for you are both the shackled inmate and the warden with the key. Despite being the only one who can set myself free, something inside is stopping me from doing just that and I don\u2019t know why. \n\nI\u2019m filled with this desperate feeling that something is wrong. I\u2019ve always felt this way, that just being in this world isn\u2019t right. An unsettling sense that things aren\u2019t as they\u2019re meant to be, that there\u2019s more to this but that truth is forever out of my reach, hiding on the edges of perception, tantalising and teasing me. A sense that I was never meant to be here in the first place but I somehow ended up here anyway. It feels like I\u2019m always upon the precipice of understanding and accepting my condition, my toes hanging over this grand cliff, but as I take that final step off into empty air to plunge down into the wide sea of acceptance, I stumble as my foot falls on solid ground, beneath me is yet more of the same miserable path, contentment forever one step away. \n\nI always feel empty. Shallow and hollow, my soul is like a pit of souring blackness, a yawning emptiness filled with nought but misery and disappointment. There are moments where I appear content, and perhaps even happy, but those are rare and fleeting. A tidal wave crashes over any defence I can erect, washing away all good feelings, drowning them down in the deep depths of despair. \n\nI wish to be neither dead nor alive but rather to have never been at all.

Only a small chattering noise from the house interrupted their peace: the sound of what was to be the last news broadcast of the millennium. He could still vaguely make out what was being said, but he paid it no mind; ignorance, they say, is bliss.\n\nAfter a short discussion, they had agreed to stay put for the evening. Neither could rationalize trading the comfort of their plush home for some gulley or makeshift shelter when the end came for them.  So he had dragged two of their pool chairs to the edge of the deck and they then began to appreciate the sun.

It\u2019s about thirty minutes or so before dawn. The morning air is fresh and unspoiled, and I drink it in, becoming drunk on the smell of life waking up all around me. In the distance, what begins as a faint rumbling soon crescendos into a roar, culminating in the emergence of a lurching school bus from around the corner. The bus screeches to a halt in front of me, and after I\u2019ve climbed on and found a seat, the driver turns the lights back off and the bus continues its solemn journey towards the school. The roar of the diesel engine deflates my spirit, and I settle into an uneasy trance as the dark, alien world passes us by. We arrive at the school, and I walk down the sidewalk outside the school to get to my first class. On the way there, I pass the front lane of the school. The fumes of dozens of doting parents\u2019 cars penetrate my lungs, and I try not to breathe it in very much.\n\nAfter stopping by the cafeteria for a little while, I continue on to my first class, observing the campus of the school. Because of a rat problem a few years back, most of the shrubs surrounding the buildings of the school have been torn out, and weeds have grown in their place in a vain effort to cover the barren earth.\n\nAt lunch, I cringe as I watch hundreds of single-use styrofoam trays land in trash cans. I despair as I witness the many students of my school drink from their plastic water bottles, made from oil, including myself. And I experience further repulsion as I witness people throwing those same plastic bottles into the trash, because the students aren\u2019t mature enough to use a recycling bin correctly. Because I couldn\u2019t conquer the paralyzing shell of my own mind to start a school recycling program.\n\nAfter the bell rings for school to get out, I again walk around the front of the school to get back to the bus lanes. I see the same parents waiting to pick up their spoiled children.\n\nWhile sitting on the bus riding home from school, I look at the environmental atrocities \u2013 the filth and litter and artificial barrenness \u2013 that characterize the streets of my hometown and so many other cities like it. And I know that no matter what I do in the future, no matter how hard I work to clean up after centuries of people, I cannot do it alone. I need their help. But, as I sit there on that bus, contemplating all these things, I begin to fear that they will only realize what is happening when it gets bad. And I know that by then, it will most likely be too late. The climate will be changing too fast to stop it, and the ecological damage will be so tremendous that our fragile society will not be able to survive it. The driver is pulling up to the last stop, my stop. I walk down the steps.\n\nI wake up crying. My eyes sting from the saltiness of my tears. I sit up from the makeshift mattress of pillows, sweating in the rags that were once blankets. The dream had triggered a deep feeling of loss and wistfulness inside of me. The smell of old books comforts me as I slowly get up. I groan from the pain in my joints. The many years of labor have weakened my body. I look up at the windows of the old library, and I see sunlight shining through them, brilliantly illuminating a shelf of faded books in harsh light. I can tell it is around mid-morning. I am confused for a moment. The angle that the sun is shining at through the windows is too small for it to be this warm. This is probably the end of January - or the beginning of February \u2013 and it should be colder. And then I remember that the year is not 2013 anymore. It\u2019s 2077.\n\nIt all starts to come back to me as I choke down my meager breakfast of carrots and dandelions. Food is scarce in the winter, and I have to rely on gathered and stored food until mid-summer, when my crops begin producing again. The unpredictable climate can oftentimes cause frosts and cold spells late into the spring, killing any seedlings planted too early. Everything keeps changing, going from bad to worse. It\u2019s been that way my whole life.\n\nAfter I finish my breakfast, I shoulder my gun and collect my pitch fork. I pry open the once automated doors of the library and step out into the vast hospice where I patiently nurse my diseased world through her last, erratic gasps. I hold tight to her loosening grasp, trying to comfort her in the twilight of our journey. I thank her for every beautiful day she ever gave me. I thank her for seeing the good in me even as I tore her down, burnt her up, and poisoned her. I know she would have been better off had she never met me \u2013 the toxic parasite that she never stopped loving, never stopped believing was her own. Maybe at first she thought I would grow to appreciate and respect her, that I would change, that I would see the error in my ways. She might have thought I could give her immortality amongst the stars at some point. But those dreams have long since been torn up and whisked away by the shifting winds that carry the scent of death across the sunbaked plains and burnt out cities. Soon, the winds will be upon us, and we too shall finally be carried away. In our last moments, I whisper to her memories of jubilant springs, verdant continents, and the indomitable spirit of life as we await the winds that will ferry us through the void.", "id": "115901i", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortSadStories/comments/115901i/remorse_for_our_future/", "created_utc": 1676702454.0, "score": 6, "permalink": "/r/ShortSadStories/comments/115901i/remorse_for_our_future/", "comments": [], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "Dark instinct", "selftext": "\u201cI\u2019m okay\u201d I answer while looking down at my feet. \u201cOh okay, I am just making sure.\u201d my friend says. \nI look back up and see the concerning in her eyes.

For hours now, she has been walking around in this forest, and she felt like she kept walking in a circle. Every part of this forest just looked the same! Her phone must have fallen out of her pocket a while ago, but it made no sense to try to find it now, the sky was already dark and she just wanted to find her way back home.\n\nThe reason for her to be in the forest was her best friend. In the afternoon, their parents called and asked if she knew where they were. They went for a walk in the forests and didn\u2019t come back. And here she was, searching for her best friend and ending up getting lost in the woods herself! \n\nShe sat down on a fallen over tree and started crying. Instead of helping to find them, she just made it worse. Her parents probably already worried about her and now they had to search for two people instead of one. It was so dark, she would never find her way back home!\n\nAnd while sitting on this tree and sobbing, she suddenly hear the voice of a little girl \u201eWhy are you crying? Are you lost in this forest too? Maybe we can find the way back together!\u201c She looks up and saw a child in a white dress standing in front of her and smiling at her.\n\n\u201eSure\u201c, she said, \u201eWe can find the way together\u201c and she also smiled a little for the child. When the two of them started walking, the little girl told her how she got into the forest. \u201eI was going for a walk with my Mom, but then I was a cute rabbit and I followed it, but when I lost the rabbit, I couldn\u2019t see her anymore and when I tried to find her, I just got lost even more! How did you get lost in this forest?\u201c \n\nAnd she told this little child everything about her best friend being missed and how much she was worried about them, especially because of the mental problems they had struggling with for years now. \u201eWe were about your age when I met them for the first time. You look quite a bit like them.\u201c The little girl just replied \u201eI\u2019m sure you will find them, I also have a great best friend!\u201c \n\n\n\u201eAren\u2019t you cold? It\u2019s November and you are only wearing a dress! You can have my jacket.\u201c \u201eNo, please keep your jacket on. I\u2019m not cold.\u201c The little girl replied, almost as if she was worried about her getting cold.\nNow it was completely dark, but somehow, with the company of this child next to her, she wasn\u2019t scarred and finally calmed down. Maybe everything would turn out fine..\n\nIn that very moment, she heard something that sounded like cars. \u201eHey, can you hear that? It\u2019s the street, I think I know where we are, we can go to my home and call your parents there!\u201c she said, being relieved about the good news. The little girl didn\u2019t reply. \u201eHey, are you okay? We found the way back home!\u201c \n\nThen she heard a whisper \u201eI\u2019m so sorry I couldn\u2019t stay.

If you hadn\u2019t hurtled into my life in a whirlwind of gentle caresses and a startling determination to make me yours.\n\nI knew we shouldn\u2019t have. Secret touches in the back of the movie theatre. Your legs tangled in mine as the rain fell outside your window. I knew we shouldn\u2019t have, but how could we not?\n\nYou are the God they promised me. Wasted Sundays in an empty church. It was finally my turn to worship.\n\nDo you remember the lake? We went even though it was raining, the only place where we would be guaranteed privacy. I taught you how to skip stones. You didn\u2019t know, still don\u2019t really, being the city girl that you are. We stumbled back to yours dripping wet, your hand pulling me along. Your dad was out and so we did the only thing two lovers truly know. We fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms. If only we had heard the car pull up, footsteps on the stairs heavy with intoxication. If only we hadn\u2019t fallen asleep. \n\nAt the beginning of summer, before the rain started, before you arrived in town, my mum had been told a story by a friend who had heard it from a neighbour. A story about a stolen kiss, the kind that two young girls should not steal from one another. I didn\u2019t mean to steal that kiss. Drunk at an end-of-year party, music thumping, the world spinning around me, it was easy to forget that some stories are best left untold. I wish I could tell you how much you saved me when a week later you came out of the rain asking for directions to the nearest shop. New in town and alone you didn\u2019t know, didn\u2019t know that I walked the streets a pariah. I told you and you didn\u2019t care. We talked for hours that day. You were terrified of starting a new school, glad that you had a friend now. You walked me home, past the church, under the safety of your umbrella, and made me promise to see you the next day.\n\nI wish I could tell you now just how much you saved me. I\u2019m so tired now, but I\u2019m not in pain anymore. I can\u2019t feel much of anything anymore. I didn\u2019t think he would shoot, but he was drunk and you were so scared. You\u2019re scared now, scared I\u2019ll die. I\u2019m sorry, I know how much you hate cliche tragedy, barely made it through Romeo and Juliet when I made us watch it. Yet here we are, your lover bleeding out in your arms.\n\nIt\u2019s not raining today. Look, out the window, I can see the sun.\n\nWe\u2019ve always known, haven\u2019t we? That we weren\u2019t made to last, that even in another time we won\u2019t be remembered. You like those poems, don\u2019t you? I never understood why. That kind of hope is unrealistic. But you like them so I read them. Our love will die with us as so many before us and as it will with so many to come.\n\nBut that\u2019s okay, isn\u2019t it?

Never again.\n\nIt\u2019s not raining anymore, but I\u2019ll dream of the rain, here in your arms. The way it might wash away my sins, just how endless Sundays promised but could not. I know if my eyes are to close now that they will not open again. Your face will be the last thing that I see in this form before I am claimed by Death. I think that I am okay with that. I will close my eyes dreaming of the rain. Free in a way that we could never truly be. Maybe it\u2019s for the best that we are not free, slaves to our faith and the expectations of others, for nothing is more unbearable, once one has it, than freedom.\n\nI never told you that that was when I knew I loved you, our day at the lake, in the rain. I knew then that you would have my heart for as long as it may beat and when my heart lies still, it will remember my love for you. I never told you that, did I? I wish I could now.\n\nI will think of the rain when I go. Of the rain softening the ground so that the earth will accept me back into its warm embrace.

He ate, he slept, he did chores and made art, just an ordinary man, except for one thing. His entire world was grey. Shades of black, grey and white were all he saw. It was all he knew. He didn\u2019t mind, as long it was his world, he was content.\n\nThen one morning, came a thump at the door. He opened the door to find nothing, but upon looking down, he saw a fairy, dazed in the snow below. Unsure of what to do, he took the fairy in. Days past. The fairy was now living with the man. This fairy was special. Where ever it touched or looked, suddenly sprang to life in color. The fires turned red, the skies blue, the plants green. \n\nAt first the man didn\u2019t like this. It was different from what he knew all his life, and he was scared of what this might mean. But as the weeks went by, he soon found that he could not live with those colors, those reds, blues, and greens, and the fairy that brought it to him.\n\nOne morning however, he heard a knock at the door. When he opened it, he found a large man, covered in furs, who said this.\u201d I am the Spirit of the Forest, and I have lost one of my fairies. If it\u2019s possible, would you let me have her back? She\u2019s very important to me.\u201d The man was unsure about this, the fairy had brought an important gift to his life, and was afraid of what might happen if he let it go. \n\nBut he thought about the fairy and where she belonged. He looked about his cabin, and then the woods beyond. He thought for a long moment, about himself, and of his life, before finally letting the spirit inside. Before long, the spirit and the fairy had departed back where they came. That night, the man laid on his old bed, fearing to close his eyes, afraid of what the morning would bring if he dared to fall asleep.\n\nAs he awoke, and gazed around, he saw what he had expected. That his world had once again turned back to the darkness he knew so well. The grey had never really left, but had simply been covered by the vivid colors brought by the fairy. He sighed a heavy breath, and got up to begin the day, the same day he lived a thousand times over, when he noticed something. \n\nIn the corner, on the easel, was a canvas, a painting. He had made it earlier that week. As he held it in his hands and took in the view, tears sprung to his eyes. It was a painting he had made of the moment he had met the fairy, and of the days they had spent together. It was a piece that showed his happiest times, the days that he held closest in his heart.

Back then, we didn\u2019t have water-wings or any of that fancy crap they have nowadays.  So, I had this rubber ball that I would hang onto, and I would kick my legs and swim out into the deep water.  And when I say deep water \u2013 I mean really deep water \u2013 like a straight drop-off like a cliff.  I couldn\u2019t really swim, but I could move around and stay afloat as long as I could hang onto that blue rubber ball.  \r\n\r\n\u201cSo anyways, one day we were there and I remember it was a beautiful, sunny day, not a cloud in the sky.  The quarry had a few other people there, but mostly it was just me and my parents, your Oma and Opa.  They were on the beach and I was out in the water with my blue rubber ball, kicking my legs and swimming out in the deep water.  \r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then suddenly it slipped!  The blue rubber ball that was supposed to be my life-preserver \u2013 off it went and was gone.  And I flopped around for a bit and then started to sink.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy dad\u2019s eyes were glossy, looking far away in thought at the memory.  Over the years he did that more and more, lost in remembering, and I wondered later if he was recalling what it felt like to be sinking, down into the murky cold water of that quarry, looking up at the surface so far away, and unable to get there. \r\n\r\n\u201cI remember that feeling, of drowning.  What a horrible feeling.  All you want is to take a breath of air but you can\u2019t, you\u2019re stuck down there and you can\u2019t breathe.  I couldn\u2019t call for my mom to help me or my dad.  I was just down there in the cold water, waiting to die.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember how long I was down there, but he rescued me.  This man I had never seen before.  He was dressed all in white, I remember that.  I remember seeing him standing there, in his white suit, soaking wet, and wondering who this strange man was dressed all in white.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy dad liked to tell me stories when I couldn\u2019t sleep, and that one was one of my favourites.  The mysterious man in white who had saved him from drowning.  I wouldn\u2019t be alive without the man in white.  I owed him my life as well.  \r\n\r\nThat wasn't my father's only brush with death.  He told my brother and I a hundred stories.  A thousand.  The Hobbit and the Hitchhiker's Guide, all the prerequisite works of fiction needed for a lifetime of nerdom.  \r\n\r\nAnother time I was having trouble sleeping he told me the story of his accident on the Autobahn.  His friend driving this super VW Beatle they had crafted with a Porsche engine under the hood, a black devil with a top hat painted on the side of it. \r\n\r\nThey had been driving too fast in icy weather and he said he remembered a military convoy passing them, then his friend suddenly lost control.  The top heavy car tipped over and began to spin on its roof on the ice.  He said he was in a coma for four weeks after that before waking up.  He'd tell that story and point to his palms, his fingers, or to the bags under his eyes. \r\n\r\n\u201cI just pulled out a little piece of glass the other day.  I still find them. Little shards in my skin all these tears later.\u201d\r\n\r\nSometimes I think about that.  All those little pieces of glass living in his body.  How strange it would feel to pull a shard of windshield from your finger or out from under your eye after all those tears. He always told me it didn't hurt.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nI was plagued by night terrors for many years.  Horrifying nightmares that would dissolve from my memory upon waking.  All I would remember usually was the terror I felt.  \r\n\r\nBut one particular dream was so horrifying and awful that I couldn\u2019t help but recall it, despite my mind\u2019s efforts to repress it.  The dreams I had of my parents dying.  \r\n\r\nMy fear of the death of my parents was completely irrational, most would think.  But to me it was entirely justified.  My cousin\u2019s parents would drop him off on our door step and then go off on benders and would disappear for weeks at a time, leaving my parents to take care of him.  Perhaps part of me saw that and wondered, what would happen to me if they disappeared?  Who would take care of me?  \r\n\r\nThe simple answer was \u2013 no one.  \r\n\r\nIf my parents were gone I would be left alone with my disjointed extended family, who didn't even care enough to take care of their own kids.  The thought of that subconsciously scared me more than any horror movie. \r\n\r\nIt got so bad that I couldn\u2019t concentrate in school.  I was up all night long, afraid to fall asleep.  If I did manage a little bit of rest I would wake up screaming and crying and wouldn\u2019t be able to get back to sleep again after that.  \r\n\r\nSo my dad decided to teach me a trick.  He showed me how to have lucid dreams.  He told me he had taught himself the trick by reading a book about it, after having recurring dreams about the man in white.  He said he had wanted a way to control the dreams, since he couldn't get away from that memory of drowning. \r\n\r\nFor those who don\u2019t know, lucid dreaming means that while you're asleep you recognize you are dreaming and take control.  You can fly around the world if you want to.  You can vanquish your nightmares with a single thought.  You can bring your parents back from the dead.  \r\n\r\nThe trick was simple.  Every so often, during the day, while you\u2019re awake, you ask yourself, \u201cis this a dream?\u201d  And you just keep doing that over and over and over, until eventually you start doing it in your dreams.  During a nightmare, you\u2019ll find yourself asking, \u201cis this a dream?\u201d  And that\u2019s when you can answer, \u201cyes,\u201d and destroy those vampire demons who are hunting you with a fireball spell, if you so desire.  Because YOU have the power when you\u2019re lucid dreaming.  \r\n\r\nThat ended up getting rid of my nightmares pretty much forever.  I still have the odd one, but I can catch it in its tracks by asking myself\u2026    \r\n\r\nIs this a dream?  \r\n\r\nI walked into the coffee shop.  My dad was being held upright by my uncle.  They were sitting in a booth at the back of the place where we were going to meet to talk.  My mom was there too, sitting across from them, looking wide-eyed and nervous.  \r\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t just that my uncle was holding him upright, it was how he was holding him upright.  He was holding up his chin, trying to force it upwards.  \r\n\r\nConfused, I walked over and saw the colour of my dad\u2019s face was all wrong.  Pale and grayish.  His eyes were closed and he was making noises like he was sleeping.  Someone was standing behind my mom saying she was on the phone with her own mother, and that she was a doctor.  \r\n\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked.  \r\n\r\n\u201cHe just closed his eyes and put his chin down and we haven\u2019t been able to get him to wake up,\u201d my mom said.  She also had her cell phone in her hand and was talking to 9-1-1.  \r\n\r\n\u201cAre they sending an ambulance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I think so.\u201d  \r\n\r\nI lifted his eyelids up one by one and looked underneath.  The pupils were fixed.  The snoring sounds had stopped suddenly.  \r\n\r\n\u201cTell them his pupils are fixed.  I don\u2019t think he\u2019s breathing.  They need to send an ambulance right now, tell them right now!\u201d\r\n\r\nI put my fingers up to his neck to feel for a pulse.  There wasn\u2019t one.  \r\n\r\n\u201cWe need to get him down on the ground and start doing CPR, he doesn\u2019t have a pulse,\u201d I told my uncle who was still holding up his chin with all of his effort and only being partially successful.   \r\n\r\nThe stranger behind my mom shouted that her mother the doctor didn\u2019t think that was a good idea.  I don\u2019t remember what I said back to her, but it probably wasn\u2019t anything pleasant, and we continued with our efforts, bringing his body gently down to the filthy tile floor of the old coffee shop we were in.  People around us began to move tables out of the way, others began to clear out of the restaurant entirely.  I saw my brother and my wife standing a little ways away, looking over at us, and I felt like I was in a dream, but I knew I was not.          \r\n\r\n\u201cGive him breaths,\u201d I told my uncle.  \u201cTwo.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe bent over and put his face up to my dad\u2019s, his brother in law, and gave two chest-fulls of life-saving air into his lungs.  I put my hands on my father\u2019s sternum, and did thrusts with my palms and sang the song in my head.  \r\n\r\nAh-ah-ah-ah stayin\u2019 alive.  One hundred beats per minute.    \r\n\r\nThe ambulance took a while to arrive.  I pushed down on his chest over and over until my arms started to grow tired and I began to pour sweat from my forehead.  \r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, no, no, no.  Please, no.\u201d   My worst nightmare.  My greatest fear.  It was all coming true.\r\n\r\nAnd then we got his rhythm back.  I could feel it in my fingertips.  Weak, but there. \r\n\r\nHe suddenly took a huge, gasping breath.  And then another.  \r\n\r\n\u201cDad?  Dad, can you hear me?\u201d  \r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nNinety percent of out of hospital cardiac arrest patients die.  We had gotten to him quickly, at least.  \r\n\r\nThe paramedics arrived and we were kneeling on the floor, frozen in place as they walked in.  I was unsure what to do next.  He had just been breathing.  He had just had a heartbeat.  I had felt it.  I told them what had happened.  \r\n\r\nIt felt like they were moving in slow motion as they got in place around his body, and began to put ECG stickers on his chest.  Everything they were doing seemed to be taking so long, and I wanted to tell them to HURRY! HURRY!  He was dying a second ago!  He might still be, can\u2019t you see that!?\r\n\r\n\u201cNo pulse,\u201d I heard the guy closest to me say, his shirt had the word \u201cSupervisor\u201d on it.\r\n\r\nThey started doing compressions again.  \r\n\r\nHis body heaved up and down and I watched, now helpless. \r\n\r\n\u201cCan you hold this?\u201d the EMS worker closest to me asked, holding out the ECG box, asking if I could tilt it to show the paramedic.  I said of course, whatever they needed.  \r\n\r\nThe coffee shop was empty now, except for my family.  \r\n\r\nAnd the man in white.  \r\n\r\nHe stood in the corner of the shop near my brother, watching.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to ask him to help.  To do something.  To save my dad like he had done when he was younger, all those years before when the blue rubber ball had slipped away from him at the quarry.  \r\n\r\nI looked down to see that the EMS workers had gotten his rhythm back again, suddenly, and when I looked up the man In white was gone, as if he had never been there at all.  But I had seen him there, I\u2019m sure of it.  \r\n\r\n\u201cYou know you probably just saved his life,\u201d the paramedic said to me outside the coffee shop.  I nodded, unable to speak with sudden tears in my eyes, hoping he was right.  \r\n\r\nWe followed the ambulance to the hospital, and when we got inside they told us gently to go into a room in the back.  It looked like a doctor\u2019s lounge of some sort.  \r\n\r\nThe noisy clock in the room ticked, counting the seconds as we waited for news.  I kept exchanging nervous glances with my mom, who was saying to keep praying.  He was going to be okay, right?\r\n\r\nEventually a doctor came in and told us things weren\u2019t looking good.  They had lost his rhythm again in the ambulance and had gotten it back a few times since then but were running out of options.  \r\n\r\nWe insisted on going out to see him.  I saw him hooked up to lines and wires and looking no better than before, only worse.  Fresh blood splattered on him.  A bag breathing into his mouth.  My living nightmare.  His living nightmare.  He would have never wanted this, I couldn\u2019t help but think to myself.  \r\n\r\nHe died a little while later, and I realized it had all been for nothing.  They told us he had had a massive heart attack.  There was nothing any of us could have done.\r\n\r\nWhen I remember him now, I try to forget about that day.  The terror I felt at my worst fears coming true.  I try to remember the good times we had together.  \r\n\r\nPlaying golf, working on cars together, talking about music and comedy and religion and politics.  Cooking together, laughing together.  All the things that made me so afraid to lose him.  \r\n\r\nMost of all, I\u2019ll miss his stories.  Especially the one about the time he was saved by the man in the white suit.\r\n\r\n[JG]( https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)", "id": "yonlqj", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortSadStories/comments/yonlqj/dont_look_twice_at_the_man_in_white/", "created_utc": 1667829305.0, "score": 11, "permalink": "/r/ShortSadStories/comments/yonlqj/dont_look_twice_at_the_man_in_white/", "comments": [], "URLs": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)"], "html_title": ["JGcreepypastas"]}, {"title": "Autumn Flotsam", "selftext": "She was very good at hiding in the leaves, our little Grace.

She was as skinny as a twig, and her eyes were hollow, like she had seen all the horrors of the world.\n\nShe was apprehensive at first, as I held out some sunflower seeds that I found, and pecked warily at the food.

He could pull himself over to reach it, and so he did.\n\nHe was dumbfounded at the fact that it was an oil-burning lamp, as though straight from a bad cartoon. It was tarnished, save the few bits which shone to him. The lamp had been placed as though to shine directly at him and nothing else. He rubbed the lamp, as one would. He had already experienced one impossible miracle, why not experience another?\n\nOut came a genie; blue-skinned, middle-eastern attire, a djinn of the ancient world appearing before him.\n\n\"I will grant you one wish, my good man! For you, who was destined to find me and to free me. You could have anything: riches, fame, glory! Your wish, of course, is my command! Anything at all that your heart desires.\"\n\nHe considered every option available to him. Maybe time travel, maybe he could wish it better. Maybe he could wish to be someone else. \n\nThe man's mind wandered far away to the only thought which plagued him for the last four years. Despite his car, despite his crash, despite the very magic that had suddenly appeared before him.\n\nAt last he said, somberly but sincerely,\n\n\"Just kill me.\"", "id": "y1pwel", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortSadStories/comments/y1pwel/you_finally_found_a_genie/", "created_utc": 1665536737.0, "score": 9, "permalink": "/r/ShortSadStories/comments/y1pwel/you_finally_found_a_genie/", "comments": ["Great story!"], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "The boy who saw the grey sky", "selftext": " I love how beautifully blue the sky is every day, those were the boy\u2019s thoughts every morning.\n\nHe walked through the bright green forest, the boy hoped that he could spend his days like this forever.

The boy was amazed at the sight and instantly went to pet the beautiful creature.\n\nQuickly the boy pulled his hand back, did the wolf have red paint on its fur? Why was it flowing down the boy\u2019s hand? What was this uncomfortable feeling in his hand?\n\nThe boy seemed confused while noticing that the beautiful blue sky turned a little darker, he didn\u2019t think much of it, the sky was still very beautiful, so the boy decided to wander even deeper into the forest.\n\nHe saw a huge red flower and rushed towards it and was amazed at its beauty, the petals being a deep shiny red colour, the flowers peduncle had a deep green colour and was very thick, making sure the flower can grow without breaking in. The boy wanted to take the flower back home, so he grabbed it by the stem and tore it off and put it in his backpack.\n\nThe boy then saw a huge creature in the far, he hurried over to the creature to exam it further, without noticing that the sky has darkened once more. The boy has never seen such a magical creature, it resembled a bear in some sort, the boy wanted to touch its fluffy fur and feel it on his hand.\n\nThe boy didn\u2019t understand the creature, was it trying to give him a hi 5? The boy\u2019s arm was now dripping with red paint and the boy was feeling dizzy.\n\nAll of the sudden the boy didn\u2019t see well anymore; it was as though the sky itself darkened and didn\u2019t let any light pass through anymore. Why was the creature following him now? The boy didn\u2019t understand this, he just wanted to go home, the boy was feeling scared for the first time in his life, he didn\u2019t understand all this, he just wanted to experience the wonderful blue sky.\n\nThe boy was running through the forest, confused and scared, unable to see anything, he kept running until he finally saw the light. He ran as fast as he could, as suddenly he felt his feet being grabbed, he looked back only to see a glim outline of a flower. Was the flower that he picked up blocking him from getting home? Why? The boy was in pain, losing too much of his \u201cred paint\u201d.\n\nUsing his arms, nails... teeth... the boy managed to get away from the flower, but... why couldn\u2019t he walk? And why was his foot facing the wrong direction?\n\nThe boy felt a warm, familiar feeling on his cheeks, as he finally managed to touch the light.

S. Million (JSM) were a sect of radical utilitarians who left Liverpool in 1865 to establish in South America a utopian colony called Evertham-or-Paradise.\n\nDespite their name, their members numbered in the hundreds.\n\nTheir history is today relatively obscure.\n\nOur knowledge derives from a selection of official records, one Spanish-language secondary source, and parts of several journals, including those of the leader, Eliezer Axelis; the convict-rebel, John Grousewater; and the widow, Elizabeth Harrow.\n\nAxelis\u2019 governing principle was simple: the maximisation of happiness, with happiness measured as *total happiness* in the colony.\n\nThis required the security of all members, as the loss of anyone was a loss of total happiness; and procreation, as the addition of anyone was an addition of total happiness.\n\nBy year three, the JSM had achieved the first goal, but lagged in achieving the second.\n\nWomen were uneager to birth.\n\nUnder these conditions Axelis instituted what he termed \u201cthe partakings,\u201d and what Elizabeth Harrow later called \u201cthe rape chamber.\u201d It was, he declared, \u201cthe inevitable product\u2026 of a moral calculus\u201d expressed \u201cin the mathematics of practical application.\u201d\n\nNine months later, happiness in the colony greatly increased.\n\nYet there were misgivings, questions about the morality of the partakings and the very definition of happiness; a disagreement in principle.\n\n\u201cWhat is the maximisation of happiness?\u201d asked John Grousewater in his pamphlet of 1870, *Futilitarianism*, before answering: \u201cIt is not *total happiness*, but *happiness on average*, which must be maximised!\u201d\n\nAxelis jailed Grousewater, but the heretical idea persisted, fomenting into a rebellion that toppled Axelis, freed Grousewater and redefined the JSM. Whereas, before, maximum happiness had required security and procreation, now it necessitated elimination.\n\n\u201cElegance and reason,\u201d Grousewater declared. \u201cNot breed\u2014but cull.\u201d\n\nUnder banners proclaiming *Kill For Happiness*, he began planning the identification and execution of the JSM\u2019s unhappiest members, and he decided that the first such act would need to be the one with the greatest positive impact: the death of the most-miserable member of the colony.\n\nThe search commenced.\n\nInterviews were conducted. Gallows constructed.\n\nOn December 2, 1871, three Interviewers entered the home of Elizabeth Harrow, whom they found weeping over the body of her dead child.

The sound of the heavy rain, which she had known for all her life, accompanied every living soul in a proximity of hundreds of miles. She had never left her city, her supposed home. The gigantic, gray, brutal buildings were all she knew. There were millions like her. Millions of people wandering from place to place, living their lives, all with one common denominator. The heavy, never-ending, downpour of rain. The Grey clouds, always littering the sky, drowning the city in an eternal shroud of darkness. She sat on the ledge of her window, looking down at the sad lights of the lonely city full of people. She looked towards the horizon, or much rather towards what would\u2019ve been the horizon, had there not been an endless array of tall gray buildings in the way. She wondered what the sun was like. What it was like to feel the embrace of her warm, comforting rays of light. All she knew, however, was the sad rhythm of the never ending rain. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Only from her small window, high above the maze of the buys streets, she felt somewhat free. She had often thought about what it would be like to fall. What it would be like to be one with the rain. Finally, united for an eternal lasting moment, with the one common denominator of the only life she knew. Maybe it was her destiny. Maybe it was not. Maybe she was meant to leave this world. Maybe there was a place for her somewhere else. Maybe the warm rays of the sun were awaiting her at the end of a raindrops journey. She opened her eyes and looked at the dark, almost tar colored clouds. How could one move forward if one is plagued by the uncertainty of the future? She leaned back against the side of the open window. She knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. A lonely tear slowly formed in one of her ebony eyes. It calmly rolled past her nose and made its way around her trembling, full lips. Taking its time, as if to say goodbye to all of the perfect imperfections of her face, the tear made its way to her chin, where it finally stopped moving. Her body was aching, she felt tired, so tired. The pain was rhythmically tapping against the inside of her mind, torturing the crevices of her soul. She wasn\u2019t able to contain the agony. She never could. The trauma of 21 years manifested in one tiny movement. Her lip's tremble was the small catalyst her lonely tear needed to separate itself from its inward-collapsing creator's chin. In a moment that could\u2019ve spanned all eternity, the tear fell, all of a sudden being one of billions upon billions of drops in the never-ending embrace of a world that had nothing left to give. Time didn\u2019t matter anymore. Pain didn\u2019t matter anymore. A fraction of her was now finally free. Falling, among infinite teardrops in a gray and dark world, a small part of her was only moments away of reaching the end of a raindrop's journey. \n\nShe laid in bed, listening to the steady rhythm of the rain.

trying and failing and almost killing myself more than ten time, they called mad maybe they are right, I have betrayed my only friend for greed, but it is there i have made a single drop of immortality elixir, it is in an eye dropper, so I either live or worst case scenario die, I put it in my mouth without thinking, it didn't take a second for that green drop to make me feel as of thousand swords are passing through my throat while it is falling, I could feel it numbing my face and brain, I can't scream or think I can only shiver as I'm gonna explode, I actually shivered so much it felt like an earthquake in the small wooden room I was in, my heart I can hear it from how loud and fast it is pumping, the feeling of the swords going through my full body, and I remember my family that I have left them and will never see again, till the pain reached the end of my toes and then all was black, I opened my eyes and I see the world in a way I have never seen before, everything looks kind of yellow and I see colors I have never seen before, I'm almost levitating a little bit above the ground, I can't feel my heart I can't feel anything, did I die ?, no I see myself in the mirror and I'm touching things, I feel a little bit of pins and needles all over my body but I can feel things the harder I grab them, I have made it, I did it I became immortal I left on my horse came quickly to my family who I missed so much but I can't feel them like before, maybe it is the side effect but I can't feel body heat even mine, I didn't know about that I tried and tried and tried but I can't sleep I don't need to sleep so I can't no matter how hard I try and no matter how many milk I drink and food I eat with my numb tongue to taste it, I can't taste them and all of the food and drinks I take comes out from me the way they were, as if my body tells me it doesn't need it, I ignored that I really did ignore that, till i have seen the first white hair in my son's head and my wife's death I tried to cry but I couldn't all my body fluids are gone, even my arteries and veins are disappearing my gum color is slightly getting brighter as well as my lips, it was the breaking point when I realized that I have been 20 years with no sleep and I went to my son's to see his wife crying at his hand on her knees as her daughter's try to comfort her, I saw as the wrinkles on both of their faces grow, I still can't do it, I still can't do it I can't cry I can't express my sadness or anger or shock  or anything I forgot my own laughter , the people at the funeral didn't know me, they thought I was my son's brother I nodded my head so they don't call me crazy when they said that, I looked so pale that one who was concerned said to me: \" are you sick ?\" I looked at him and I said: \" I wish \"   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday I'm writing this after 475 years of living this meaningless life and being chased by my friend's ghost who is mocking me and reminding me everyday of what I did to him I know he is driving me crazy as if I'm not there already, I have heard even when I escaped my town because I couldn't stand anymore seeing my 7th grand child death I even changed my name so the people don't know who I'm anymore but I have heard that my 20th generation grand child death and he had the same name of my so, so it brought back all of my memories I spent two months sitting in my chair trying to force a tear with no use, used hundreds of swords to cut my wrist with no use not even a scratch, thrown myself in fire couple times till it got turned down on it is own, with just naked body and burnt cloth, after reading and reading, this can be the answer I read many books and discovered that this effect can be reversed, if the one who had the elixir could fall down through a sword dripping in cat's blood, I climbed up the highest stairs and see the pointed sword beneath me covered in cat blood that I have killed this morning, and jumped on it after saying: \" please god \"   it is black again, I opened the door of my room looking at the sun seeing my friend coming from distance asking me with a smile: \" how was it ?\"  I smiled for the first time  and asked him \"do you forgive me ?\" He said: \"you did me a favor, you taught me what life really is and that is why I'm grateful\" I said: \"we can still belong together right?\" he smiled to me as he said: \" of course \" as he walked forward and I walked behind him as the broken shattered sword behind me as the others who I tried cutting my wrist with, and me saying to myself: \" I know I will find way I can finally feel it darling I can escape this curse of elixir with you\" I say it as I see my wife and children young like me look at me and smile, as i walk to

At least, not statistically. At school I\u2019m just a normal teenage boy who hates classes and doesn\u2019t do his homework. Everyone knows who I am, but no one talks to me. I sit alone at lunch, with no friends to talk to. When I go home things only get worse. I walk in my front door every day, greeted by the stone cold stare of my parents. I know what I did. But I can\u2019t help it; I have no friends and not even the tutors will work with me. I walk past my parents while they scream at me. I\u2019ve heard this rant a million times, there\u2019s no need to pay attention anymore. It\u2019s always \u201cYou\u2019re a shitty son!

I\u2019ve written hundreds of notes, but they always end up in the trash. I\u2019ll do whatever homework I feel like doing. After all, it doesn\u2019t matter anymore.

I grab something from the fridge - it looks edible. Around 9 I go to bed. It\u2019s about this time that I just feel like I can\u2019t do this anymore. I fall asleep surprisingly easily.

And nothing hurt that much- the hospital was such a fun place anyway- more toys than she ever had at home, and there was a huge model trains set with different stations and little people and buttons you could press to make the lights go on and off and the rails turn and click.\n\nBut best of all was the giant fish tank. The big glass window covered an entire wall almost- and there were many colorful beautiful fish, big and small, swimming about, in and out of a beautiful mermaid palace with silver and green lights, and a ship, and all sorts of wavy plants and fantastic rocks. Melinda could look at them forever, which was just as well, because sometimes the hospital visits took hours and hours.\n\nBut Melinda could never get bored watching the fish. She was there so much these days that she recognized most of them and gave them names- the bright pink and yellow one she called Flower, and then Sucker One and Sucker Two, who stuck to the glass pane and cleaned it, and Leopard, Funky and silly Daisy with her round open mouth, and the big ones: Moon and Ocean. But Flower was her favourite, with her stunning colours and she swam about even more gracefully than the others.\n\nAs Melinda spent more and more time there, she began making up stories about the fish, how Flower and Funky were best friends and swam about in the mermaids\u2019 palace and the ship together and wouldn\u2019t play with silly Daisy, and how Moon and Ocean squabbled over the food and wouldn\u2019t share it properly with the rest, but wise old Leopard would talk to them and make sure everyone got their fair share.\n\nSometimes, when it hurt a lot, Moon and Ocean would behave even more badly. They bullied Funky and Flower until they escaped to the palace and hide. One time it hurt so much and that was when Daisy got her silly open mouth stuck on one of the smaller spiky plants and was squiggling frantically head down, trying to break free, the eye facing Melinda wide open and terrified. Daisy wasn\u2019t there at the next hospital visit.\n\nIt must have been a few visits after that when everything was awful and Melinda screamed with pain, later on she was in the waiting room and she watched Moon and Ocean chase Flower, tearing pieces off her delicate beautiful floaty fins and then her body, Flower was swimming crooked, Funky and Leopard were hiding in the mermaid\u2019s palace.\n\nMelinda watched in horror as Moon and Ocean ripped Flower apart as she was still moving, bright pink and yellow pieces of her falling slowly on the tank floor.\n\nMelinda\u2019s knees buckled and she fell too and she never watched fish after that.", "id": "r1ukpt", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortSadStories/comments/r1ukpt/fish_tank/", "created_utc": 1637839720.0, "score": 13, "permalink": "/r/ShortSadStories/comments/r1ukpt/fish_tank/", "comments": [], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "Slow poison", "selftext": "He is a man whose blood just keeps draining.

She tried to get closer to him. His body now smoldering. Burn marks began to take shape on her arms and face. She winced in pain and shushed her almost as quickly. They watched his show again. \n\nThe next night was a little different. He came home as usual. Grabbed a beer and went to the couch. \u201cWhere\u2019s dinner?\u201d He asked. \u201cThere\u2019s two nights of leftovers in the fridge.\u201d Smoke began filling the room, billowing out from his pores. Angry that she\u2019d suggest he eat that as she must know he didn\u2019t like it. Or maybe she was too stupid to realize that. He didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t eat out of principle. She came over after some time and told him they need to talk. \u201cYou know, my friends and family.. they ask me about my burn marks. They know that it\u2019s from you and I can\u2019t hide it anymore. I don\u2019t mind.. I understand that it happens.

It would be easier than trying to justify the burns she thought. \n\nSome times passes. The girlfriend no longer keeps in touch with anyone but him. Their relationship was too complicated for them to understand she thought. But he wasn\u2019t around enough to fill the loneliness. He wasn\u2019t around at all. And when he was here, he was absent. She figured she just needed to prove to him to enjoy being home. She learned a new recipe and spent hours cooking. She cleaned the house and organized his belongings. She bought seasonal decorations for the living room. She was determined. \n\nA typical night like any other. He slammed the front door behind him and went to the fridge. His body lightly smoking, he grabs a beer and heads to the couch. The girlfriend brought over his dinner to him. He eats a few bites. \u201cThis is pretty good. \u201c he said. She was giddy with excitement. \u201cCan we watch a movie together?\u201d She asked. He gave it a moment and said \u201cyeah, put something on\u201d. Halfway through the movie the girlfriend can be seen cuddling against him. She says she hopes he likes his dinner, and asked if he noticed the decorations. Excitedly she mentions how she cleaned everything, including his usual mess of things that didn\u2019t belong on the floor. \n\n\u201cWhy did you touch my fucking things?\u201d He shouted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.. but look everything is organized and I\u2019ll show you where it is. \u201c \u201cI knew where it was and left it there!

She got off the floor and wiped a tear away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t touch your stuff anymore. Is it okay if I sat next to you?\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything, but the smell of burning cotton filled the air. Some time passes and she leans against him, hoping he\u2019ll forgive her, and looking for the only comfort she\u2019ll ever get now. She begins to nod off. Imagining what she can do to fix this, and to get him to see how hard she tries. Infuriated, he knows this must be a trick. This guilt. He didn\u2019t ask for the nice dinner, or the decorations, or to clean up. Is he expected to do something now in return? He just wanted to be left alone. And now the cuddling.

The cave walls formed natural barriers from invasion, as well as the elements. He had enough food stockpiled to last through the winter, perhaps much longer. The cave's opening had been camouflaged with tree branches and moss; it was not only difficult to find, but formidable to breach. A natural spring burbled near the back of the cave, providing him with all the water he could want. The stream flowed into a crack in the cave wall, flushing away waste.\n\nIt was a hard life, but at least he had survived. He shed a tear at the thought of the ones that hadn't been so fortunate. The invaders seemed to come out of nowhere; their peaceful way of life was suddenly shattered by marauding bands of brigands, interested in nothing but their own sick pleasures. The peaceful way of life he and his people had built, living in harmony with nature, had been brutally upended by an endless wave of feral psychopaths.\n\nHe couldn't remember the last time he had seen anyone of his own tribe; he only ventured outside when absolutely necessary. And with all the food he had managed to put away, it would be a long time before he would need to take that risk.\n\nSuddenly he heard scratching sounds near the cave entrance, followed by all-too-familiar gibbering. A series of loud cracks echoed through the cave; they were trying to break through! He slowly rose to a standing position and found his best weapon \u2014 a strong, straight tree branch that he had sharpened on both ends. Nearby, he had also piled rocks to throw. And if worst came to worst, he was pretty good fighting with his bare hands. He crouched behind a large stone and waited breathlessly.\n\nA sudden loud splintering sound was followed by chaotic tumbling. They had broken through! Their gibbering grew more fierce as he heard them stomp into his home.\n\nBruno attacked first. Grabbing a huge stone, he hefted it towards the cave opening. He heard the stone shatter against the wall; their gibbering grew more excited. Blast it all, he thought: he had missed.\n\nSuddenly they appeared before him. Three of them, all with firearms! Bruno knew his fate was sealed, but he refused to concede. With few options, he charged at them with his stick, bellowing ferociously. All three fired at the same time; he felt the hot sting of lead pierce him, and he crumpled.\n\nBruno curled up on the ground, shivering in terror, hearing them amble up to him as he felt his life slip away.\n\n\"Yee haw!\" exulted one of the hunters. \"Healthy looking sucker, ain't he?\"\n\n\"That's the biggest bear I've seen in years,\" crowed another. \"He shure will look good in our clubhouse.\"\n\n\"Of course, we'll have to pose him to look something fierce,\" the last pointed out. \"Won't do to display him all bunched up in fear like that.\"", "id": "q8mz43", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortSadStories/comments/q8mz43/home_invasion/", "created_utc": 1634299319.0, "score": 6, "permalink": "/r/ShortSadStories/comments/q8mz43/home_invasion/", "comments": ["It's not always easy to spot the beasts.\n\nCheck out [my subreddit](/r/CthulhusPlayground/) for all my [stories](https://redd.it/pluf8q), including info on my just-released first novel!", "Wow this went in a different turn than I was expecting, still very well written and sad"], "URLs": [], "html_title": []}, {"title": "Act Of Mercy", "selftext": "A young child's life is filled with endless possibilities.

And then you find the *next* thing you're not good at, and even more paths close themselves off, forever. As you reach high school, the possibilities for your life have atrophied, leaving you edgy and surly. Meanwhile, the grownups in your life continue to cheer you on, acting as if nothing's wrong, as if nothing has changed, when in fact, *everything* has.\n\nHe contemplated this as he sat in his dilapidated van, up on the hillside, looking down from above, watching the incoming high school freshmen take their seats in the outdoor amphitheater. Even at this distance, he could see some of them wrote bright colors and moved energetically. A large number, though, wore dark clothes and moved sluggishly. He grimaced as he contemplated their lives' possibilities, how much they understood the strangled avenues of their futures.\n\nThe amphitheater had filled; a grownup strode toward the podium. The unrealistically optimistic speech was about to begin. Time for action, he thought impassively as he stubbed out his cigarette on the dashboard. He clambered out of his vehicle and limped to the back of the van. Throwing the doors open, he hauled out the cannon for his homemade incendiary bombs and flipped the knife switch mounted to the inside of the cargo area; the air compressor rattled with power. The attached tablet computer sprung to life; it had been pre-programmed with the layout of the terrain. As he tilted the barrel to and fro, it showed him exactly where the homespun firebombs would land.\n\nHe aimed for the entrance to the amphitheater and held down the trigger. Moving the crosshairs in a lazy, graceful circle, he skillfully circumscribed half the perimeter before the first projectiles impacted. Before many kids could react, he had scrawled the entire perimeter. Now it was a matter of covering the inside sufficiently, to ensure no one escaped the inferno. Finally, he heard the gasping of empty air; his ammo was depleted. He sighed dejectedly; this would have to do.\n\nHe drove away at a high speed, pondering how grateful they must be to him, to spare hundreds the worst part of their lives. Adolescence wasn't a phase; it was the beginning of the end.\n\nUp ahead, he saw the police had already blocked the road. *That* was fast, he thought as he clicked his tongue.\n\nHe smiled as he sped toward the impending lawful barrier. No more sending out endless copies of his re\u0301sume\u0301, only to be ignored by faceless algorithms. No more alimony checks and child support payments.

The door stopped closing, and Jonichi peered inside. Satsuki had sliced her forearms open with the knife. She stared at him with large, soulful eyes as her virtual blood pooled on the floor of her tank. Jonichi watched uneasily as Satsuki fell to her knees, shivering. She fought to raise her head, meeting his eyes again. \"I love you,\" she called softly before collapsing to the ground. Her avatar glitched a few times, then disappeared; the tank went dark.\n\n\"Satsuki?\" Jonichi rushed inside and furiously tried to punch up her profile with the keyboard. After a several-second pause, it displayed a message: \"Profile not found. Would you like to create a new one?

We had secured a place for her in the American School, and she seemed well adjusted to her surroundings. All the more so because we spoiled her silly.\n\nWhen Charlie was born, there were complications. Although I didn't know it at the time, my wife's life was in danger. Thanks to the excellent medical care she received, however, she came through OK, and Charlie, although small and underweight, entered the world a healthy baby boy.\n\nNonetheless, the first few months were difficult, with many bloodshot nights and emergency trips to the hospital. Charlie's life always seemed exceptionally fragile.\n\nIt wasn't until he was six months old that my wife and I felt we could finally relax. We found a well-regarded babysitter and, because the occasion coincided with our anniversary, met Paul and Mandy at one of Nairobi's finest restaurants\u2014\n\n\"Have you had the talk with her yet?\" Mandy asked.\n\n\"The talk?\"\n\n\"The one about where babies come from. *Where Charlie came from*.\"\n\n\"A few weeks ago,\" I said.\n\n\"The trick is being consistent,\" Paul said. \"Whatever you tell one, you *must* tell the others.\" He and Mandy had three beautiful children.\n\n\"What did you say?\" Mandy asked. \"The truth or\u2014\"\n\n\"No one tells the truth!\" Paul interrupted. \"You can't tell them the truth.

Cabbage patches are stupid.\"\n\n\"We found the idea of a stork delivering Charlie somehow noble. A right proper kind of mythology,\" I said.\n\n\"There's a rich tradition,\" said Paul.\n\n\"We hope it teaches respect for the environment,\" my wife said.\n\nMandy drank her wine.\n\nUpon returning home, we bid the babysitter goodnight.
