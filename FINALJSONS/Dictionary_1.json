Now, it is sort of a no-brainer as to why Webster does not refer to it is Georgium Sidus, named for King George, being that one of the main reasons for the creation of his dictionary was to distance those who lived in the still rather newly independent United States from the British...  But I don't understand why he opted for 'Herschel' (named after the astronomer who discovered it) when as far as I can tell it doesn't seem to have ever been a popular choice or widely used name for the planet at any point, and seems to have been predominantly used the years directly after it's discovery.\n\nWhat makes it even more curious is the definition of the word \"Uranium\" in Webster's 1828 dictionary which reads: \n\nURA'NIUM, n.  [Gr. heaven, or a planet so called.]\nA metal discovered in 1789 by Klaproth, in the mineral called pechblend.  It is occasionally found native in uran-ocher and uran-mica; but more generally it is obtained from pechblend, in which it exists with iron, copper, lead, and sometimes with arsenic, cobalt and zink.\n\nThe \"or a planet so called\" notation right before the definition seems extremely odd when considering Webster's choice as Herschel for the name of the planet.  It almost seems personal.  \n\nAnyone have any ideas?", "id": "13vlcki", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dictionary/comments/13vlcki/why_does_the_1828_version_of_webster_dictionary/", "created_utc": 1685438417.0, "score": 7, "permalink": "/r/dictionary/comments/13vlcki/why_does_the_1828_version_of_webster_dictionary/", "comments": ["I was just thinking that the \"or a planet so called\" notation could possibly be a reference to the fact that the chemist who discovered uranium, Martin Heinrich Klaproth, named his newly discovered element as 'uranium' in order to aid his good friend Johann Elert Bode in his push to have the recently discovered planet officially named Uranus.", "There\u2019s a cgp video on this [here](https://youtu.be/h3ppbbYXMxE)\n\nHave fun learning!!", "That is a weird catch, thanks for bringing it up!\n\nI agree that it seems likely the decision was influenced by Webster\u2019s political goal of making a truly American dictionary. My first though is that maybe the name Herschel was proposed by an American astronomer, but no; Uranus was proposed by the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode, and Herschel was proposed by the French astronomer Jerome Lalande. My guess is that there was still enough debate around the planet\u2019s name in 1828 so that it could\u2019ve gone either way, giving Webster enough leeway to make his own decision. According to Wikipedia, Lalande was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1781, so maybe that American connection was enough to tip Webster\u2019s favor towards it. It\u2019s also possible that Uranus was already dominant, but Webster, being a lexicographer and not a scientist, was simply mis-informed about that planet\u2019s most popular name.  \nRegarding Uranium, I agree with u/SaturnMoloch that he probably just included that as relevant etymological information, though he disagreed with the name of the planet itself. The phrase \u201ca planet so-called\u201d makes me imagine him saying \u201cThe metal is called X because some people call the planet X, but I think the planet should actually be called Y\u201d.  \nFinally, it\u2019s also possible that the discrepancy around \u201cUranium\u201d was simply a result of Dictionary fatigue. It\u2019s a well-documented fact that the quality of a dictionary tends to decrease as you go through it, because lexicographers lose energy, time, and funding as they move through the alphabet. This was especially true back when a dictionary was the work of a single scholar, slaving away in solitary drudgery. It\u2019s possible that Webster was full of strong political opinions in the H\u2019s, but by the time he got to the U\u2019s, he was too tired to really care about what the planet was called anymore.", "Thanks for that, I didn't realize that the name Herschel was also used in the encyclopedia for 1828...It seems I may have underrated the popularity of the name 'Herschel', and that it is very possible that Herschel was in fact the widely used term for the planet in the United States in 1828.  The next version of the Webster dictionary which was published in 1841 did change the name of the planet to Uranus though, which was still 9 years prior to Uranus formally being universally accepted as the name of the planet.", "Ye.

The Descriptive approach believes that it is natural for languages to change and evolve in strange new ways, and that it is the job of dictionaries to follow those changes and describe the language as it appears without judgement. The Prescriptive approach believes that dictionaries are meant to actively guide and shape the language toward some pre-conceived level of propriety, making it clear what they think on how language should be used. Dictionaries that tend more towards Description tend to be more allowing of things like slang terms, loan words, and novel word meanings, while more Prescriptive dictionaries are more tight and conservative with such things.  \nIn light of all this, it seems like you're looking for a dictionary that takes a heavily Prescriptive approach to language, as you seem to have very strong opinions on what constitutes proper English. However, the general trend in dictionaries these days is toward the Descriptive approach, which is seen as being more inclusive and diverse. I can't imagine many are being printed these days that would leave out a word like Ginormous (though, to be fair, that's partially because there aren't many dictionaries being printed these days at all).  \nIt seems that what you want is a long list of traditionally-accepted English words that you can pore over in the hopes of soaking up interesting new etymological information, which is an extremely commendable pastime. For that, I would recommend trying to find an older dictionary in good condition from a thrift shop, second-hand book store, or online sources like Abe Books or Thrift Books. In particular, I suggest the *American Heritage Dictionary*, which was founded in the 1960's when *Webster's 3rd International Dictionary* was criticized for being too permissive in its word allowance. The AHD is extremely well-researched and uses a more Prescriptive approach than its rival. While a quick check at their modern website shows that their current edition does, in fact, have a definition for the word [\"Ginormous\"](https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=ginormous), I have a physical edition from 1972 which does not contain the word. \n\nEven if that isn't exactly what you're looking for, I hope that I've given you enough information to put on the right track towards tracking down your dream dictionary!", "Good lord.
