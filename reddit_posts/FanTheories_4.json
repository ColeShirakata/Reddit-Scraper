,{"title": "[Ace Attorney] The Redd White and Grossberg Connection: How Corruption and Information Networks Eroded the Legal System in Ace Attorney", "selftext": "**SPOILERS FOR ALL GAMES IN THE SERIES EXCEPT CHRONICLES AND PL VS. AA**\n\nAce Attorney fans, let's explore a theory that connects two major figures in the Ace Attorney universe: Redd White's information conglomerate and [Marvin Grossberg's part he played](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/13049et/ace_attorney_the_possibility_of_grossberg/) alongside Redd in bringing about the Dark Age of the Law. Both were key players in the corruption and erosion of the legal system, using their networks and connections to manipulate and control the system for their own gain.\n\n[The Phantom](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom?so=search) and [Ga'ran](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Ga'ran_Sigatar_Khura'in?so=search), the main villains in Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice, respectively, aimed to undermine the established court system. However, they could have been orchestrated and enabled by individuals like Redd White and Grossberg who sought to manipulate the legal system for their gain.\n\nIn the game \"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies,\" the Phantom is revealed to be a key agent within the shadow network of the Dark Age of the Law. He is an individual who can take on the appearance and identity of others, making it difficult to track down and bring to justice.\n\nOne of the key elements of the Phantom's character is the fact that he is unable to use his true face. This is because revealing his true identity would mean his death at the hands of the shadow network. It is suggested that the Phantom has been stripped of his individuality and any sense of self, leaving him as nothing more than a tool for the shadow network to use. This is reflected in the Phantom's own words: \"I have no... 'self.' I am no one. I am nothing but an endless abyss.\"\n\nIt is possible that the Phantom is a dead soul with a name that people know, but he has been meticulously tortured and mentally wiped to the point where he no longer even remembers who he once was.\n\nOverall, the Phantom is a complex and enigmatic character, whose true identity and motivations remain shrouded in mystery for much of the game. His ability to take on the appearance and identity of others makes him a formidable opponent, and his lack of a true sense of self highlights the disturbing consequences of the shadow network's actions during the Dark Age of the Law.\n\nIn Spirit of Justice, Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in is portrayed as an antagonist who opposes defense attorneys and threatens them with death under the DC Act. This is likely done to maintain control over the duplicitous nature of the shadow network, which may be involved in stealing spirit mediums from their own country for their own nefarious purposes. The DC Act is used as a tool to silence those who oppose the regime and to prevent the truth from being exposed.\n\nFurthermore, Ga'ran's desire to summon the Holy Mother and gain immense power for herself, despite her inability to channel, led her down a path of obsession and destruction, which ultimately led to her wanting to destroy spirit mediums at all costs. This indicates her complete disregard for the culture and traditions of her own country and shows her willingness to use any means necessary to achieve her goals.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that the shadow network is itself evil, as it allowed abhorrent creations like the Phantom to exist through the torture of deceased souls. [Lady Kee'ra](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Kee'ra)'s role as a royal assassin is an indication of how deeply ingrained the shadow network's power was in the kingdom, and how far back their influence goes. The shadow network is depicted as an insidious force that operates in the shadows, manipulating people and events for its own benefit, regardless of the consequences.\n\nPhoenix Wright's cases throughout the series often involve individuals connected to Redd White or Grossberg's network. Dee Vasquez had mafia connections that allowed her to get away with terrible things, while [Robert Hammond](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_Hammond), an attorney with connections to Grossberg, may have learned Dark Age of the Law legal practices from him. The DL-6 Incident and the murder of Gregory Edgeworth suggest that judicial corruption continued even during the Misty Fey years.\n\nOther cases, such as the one involving [Dahlia Hawthorne](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131g0ul/ace_attorney_the_true_essence_of_dahlia/), reveal that there are connections between Redd White's group and the Fey family. This suggests that the corruption and manipulation of the legal system is pervasive and extends beyond just a few individuals. Moreover, there is also a distinct possibility that corrupt people are being channeled from beyond the grave by illicit Fey clan branch members who have heightened spiritual channeling capabilities like Morgan's daughter Pearl possesses.\n\nPowerful people can manipulate the legal system at the expense of justice and fairness, as seen in the [Celeste Inpax](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Celeste_Inpax) case where someone with top connections could have killed her and made it look like a suicide. This means that even organizations suited for entertainment like Global Studios and Worldwide Studios are known for skewing public conception of those opposing the status quo. An example of this is presented in Spirit of Justice, with the cartoon depicting Dhurke as an evil terrorist threatening to topple the corrupt legal system of Khur'ain. However, it should be noted that things were not necessarily that much better even in Wright's court system. Ga'ran's regime was simply more open and honest about their corruption favoring one side of individuals, and this caused those in favor of subtle regimes such as the Dark Age of the Law to want them destroyed at all costs to protect and preserve their reputation among its shadow network of clients.\n\nCorruption was present among top-tier law enforcement officials, such as [Chief of Police Detective Damon Gant](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Damon_Gant?so=search), who was willing to falsify evidence and blackmail individuals. Gant's actions had far-reaching consequences, including the murder of Neil Marshall and the wrongful accusation of Joe Darke for Neil's murder. Additionally, many good police officers were fired and demoted after the SL-9 Incident to cover-up Gant's crime, and it was likely done because of the threat top agents in the Dark Age of the Law felt about law enforcement. Damon Gant was their answer, as he respected what they all stood for. It's also highly plausible the judge in all of Phoenix's cases has connections to the Dark Age of the Law, given his connection to Damon Gant. It's also likely Gant received help from Redd White's connections, allowing him to forge evidence with impunity until the events surrounding the murder of Bruce Goodman exposed his corruption.\n\nEven financial organizations such as Ernest Amano's [Amano Group](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Amano_Group?so=search) had connections to other corrupt entities such as those affiliated with Miles Edgeworth, the von Karma family, the [Cohdopian smuggling ring](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Cohdopian_smuggling_ring), and the [Yatagaratsu](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Yatagarasu). Even the Yatagaratsu, an organization that aimed to bring justice, had [a member connected to the smuggling ring](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Shih-na), financially backed by the Amano Group. The Amano Group was able to steal incriminating evidence on [their secretary](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Manny_Coachen?so=search), allowing him to get away with murder. Some police officers may have allowed this, highlighting the systemic nature of corruption in the legal system.\n\nThese financial entities were single-handedly also responsible for taking down many good people in the Republic of Zheng Fa. Additionally, Chief Prosecutor Blaise Debeste, Police Warden Patricia Roland, and a body double for \"Di-Jun Huang\" were responsible for the assassination of Zheng Fa's noble president. The man had his failings, sure, but he was a man who still tried to make things right with his son in the end. However, even [his son](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/John_Marsh?so=search) is not free from the pull of Global Studios, which likely has members with ties to the Dark Age of the Law as well, as evidenced by someone like [Dee Vasquez](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Dee_Vasquez).\n\nShi-Long Lang's own father, [Dai-Long Lang](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Dai-Long_Lang), had to find out the brutal truth behind what Blaise, Roland, and the body double did to their nation's president, but he knew that he had to keep quiet about the truth. Why? Because the shadow network was still around and would have torn his family apart as well if he squealed. In addition, he knew that revealing the truth would practically cause anarchy in the republic entirely. But in the end, this only led to the shadow network gaining a greater foothold of power in the Republic of Zheng Fa through their connections to the false president. It also led to the name of the House of Lang being tarnished through the mud for daring to stand for what was right, even if some of their philosophies of detainment were pretty brutal.\n\nThe false president also highlights strong ties to the Phantom in Dual Destinies, revealing how body doubles exist in Ace Attorney, and can cause devastating impacts on a great majority of people.\n\nIt makes one wonder with the inconsistencies surrounding Phoenix Wright's character as the Forgin' Attorney, especially when one considers Wright's takedown of [Kristoph Gavin](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12zgcd4/ace_attorney_how_phoenix_wrights_alleged_culprit/), whether even Phoenix Wright was immune to these body double connections. After all, Furio Tigre almost got away with posing as Wright in a court of law, and the court system overlooked it completely. This miscarriage of justice only highlights a greater problem existing within the confines of the Ace Attorney universe. And this connection pervades and will always be present unless the light gets shown on the top leaders responsible for all of the twisted evils that they perpetuated across the entire world.\n\nIn summary, Redd White and Marvin Grossberg were instrumental in the corruption and erosion of the legal system in the Ace Attorney universe. What do you think of this theory? Do you have any other evidence or connections to add? Let's discuss it in the comments!", "id": "131dftt", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131dftt/ace_attorney_the_redd_white_and_grossberg/", "created_utc": 1682644387.0, "score": 14, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/131dftt/ace_attorney_the_redd_white_and_grossberg/", "comments": ["But this doesn't make any sense because the true culprit of UR-1 incident was Athena Cykes. The Phantom was shown to be capable of avoiding any casualties, while also sabotaging the rockets successfully. And the presented way of them supposedly retrieving their psychological profile was unbelievable, considering we were to believe that there was supposed to be only one copy of it. The only way that she got away with it was that while meeting Wright overseas, she miraculously changed her course towards the rushing of getting of attorney's badge. And that was only to avoid further suspicions and guarantee freedom, with using to her advantage the events up to 5-5. The GYAXA utility knife was never truly found, and The Phantom used another years later, similarly as when Wright tried to corner Kristoph with the bloody ace. And they almost succeeded, but Edgeworth let Phoenix guess an alternative explanation and let both Simon and Athena off the hook. Then why let Athena be the protagonist if her past was not truly cleared out, especially during the time up to the incident that happened when she met Wright overseas?", "Interesting rebuttal.\n\nBut the thing about your rebuttal I don\u2019t get fully is whether Starbuck\u2019s death (or even Clay\u2019s for HAT-2) counts as an acceptable casualty for the Phantom or not. I mean, technically, Starbuck was supposed to have died on the HAT-1 launch, so it\u2019s arguable that the Phantom didn\u2019t like the fact that the guy brought the Hope Probe back with their blood still on the moon rock.\n\nAlthough yeah, the whole recording of the Phantom\u2019s voice was weird. Metis definitely was a shady mother and scientist ngl. Also where in the world is Athena\u2019s father because that makes me kinda think of her as a reverse Apollo. So Athena secretly becoming a murderer and getting covered up by Simon is decently believable given certain contexts of how Athena was raised.\n\nOn another note, I\u2019d like to point out that the Phantom might have quickly realized once present with Clay and Starbuck that the two of them were actually in the museum and away from the bomb that he placed to sabotage the launch because of Yuri Cosmos messing with shit. Are you arguing the Phantom didn\u2019t want to get the moon rock back from Clay with their blood on it following the HAT-1 Miracle? Was Phoenix just making shit up and forging like there was no tomorrow?\n\nAlso, on a peripheral note, why did the Phantom fudge Clay\u2019s prints for Athena\u2019s if they knew Athena actually did it? There\u2019d be no need for the Phantom to bother with doing this unless Phoenix was forging evidence for Athena or something.\n\nPlot twist: Yuri Cosmos is Athena\u2019s dad and covered things up for her.", "It was shown that the Phantom's weakness was their paranoia. The capsule was going to space regardless. And It is hard for me to believe that a questionable blood sample ever mattered. It only starts to matter when Phoenix uses it as an argument in court. Which is again similar to the bloody ace argument. But Edgeworth only cared about a believable explanation and to avoid being accused of corruption. Clay's demise was only due to struggle and Phantom uses his body to leave the GYAXA knife, which does work because Apollo starts to suspect Athena but for the wrong reason and wrong crime. Athena's actions were the most suspicious, or should I say the lack thereof because she always knew about Simon's sentence but never did anything meaningful with it besides what benefited her image.", "Interesting theory. I would like to provide an alternative for Athena.\n\nShe went off to Germany following her mother\u2019s death, likely meaning she either went to her grandparents or some foster family. In other words, if Athena were put into the system, she couldn\u2019t technically leave or do anything to help Simon out because she was too young to be taken seriously, and Simon didn\u2019t exactly help himself out either.\n\nIf Athena were with her grandparents, they may not have wanted her to go and rehash her own traumatic experience. Now granted, that may not have been the most healthy thing for Athena at that time, but it may have been seen as their best possible option for their granddaughter.\n\nIn any case, I was under the impression that Athena\u2019s whole purpose of becoming a defense attorney was to get Simon declared innocent for the UR-1 Incident. Now, you argue that she killed in this incident, but even if that were the case, Athena blocked the whole incident out because of black psyche locks standing for someone unconsciously hiding information from you (unless you believe this was again Phoenix making up stuff since we didn\u2019t know what Kristoph\u2019s black locks stood for in AJ, which\u2026fair point. They could mean something else or even apply to another part of Athena to allow for her to still commit UR-1)\n\nIn any case, what do you propose that Athena could have done in the Dark Age of the Law to prove that she wanted to genuinely help out Simon? Or is the whole notion of there being a Dark Age of the Law something perpetuated by corrupt lawyers and prosecutors and judges like Phoenix Wright, Miles Edgeworth, and Udgey to make people feel like the law is \u201ctaking accountability\u201d?\n\nIn other words, if Athena is behind UR-1, then she\u2019s actually not the worst person in Ace Attorney history because Phoenix and Miles and Udgey are purposely misleading the masses and falsely convicting people like the Phantom under the guise of bringing light to the Dark Age of the Law. Is that a fair assessment?", "What makes Athena's plan splendid is its execution after her moving overseas. That's because what we got here is Kristoph's dilemma, composed with Gustavias's. The first one was about the poisoned stamp that did not kill after around 7 years and the second one about was making decision about when to return to where the past crime took place while not getting caught. It was said that Athena before the UR-1 was a complete opposite to what she was during the events of the game. Meaning that she actually got better after the loss of her mother! While being overseas, all she had to do was to educate herself towards psychology in her mother's name to gain empathy points. And when the dilemma part comes is when she meets Phoenix. She does not tell him about Simon because that would make her immediately look suspicious. She also doesn't know if Simon is still alive. So, she has to tell Wright that she wants to help people as an attorney without mentioning his name at all! And all of that to win herself an acquittal in the worst scenario, and at best pretend that she did not manage to help Simon after all.", "Okay, but even still, it seems to me even with what you've said that Phoenix, Miles, and Udgey are actually way more evil than Athena even in this regard, even if Athena were a psychopath that wanted Simon to die for her crime against her mother.\n\nMy reasoning for believing this is the following:\n\nSo what if Athena got psychologically better after her mother died? We've already established that her mother did questionable things. And honestly, no father in the picture probably means that Metis might have been too absorbed in her work to even pay attention to Athena or Athena's father.\n\nAlso, even if Athena is psychopathic and did what she did solely for false empathy points from people, that doesn't automatically make her the worst individual in my eyes even if she did do UR-1. From my perspective, I'd argue that at least Phoenix should have been able to see plenty of Psyche Locks on Athena before even employing her at his agency.\n\nIf Phoenix didn't realize that Athena were evil, then I'd argue that he'd be a little silly (or downright incompetent for not carrying his Magatama around) especially given his prior actions in AJ and his lack of trust in other lawyers whom he called his former friends (like Kristoph Gavin, for example).\n\nAnd also, if Athena genuinely didn't want to help people, and she told Phoenix that as a ruse to hide what she knew about Simon, she'd still be lying to Phoenix since she's a psychopath and doesn't actually want to help people. It exactly mirrors Matt Engarde's whole \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" image that Phoenix found out about in 2-4. The reason why Matt got away with that was because he knew he shouldn't reveal anything incriminating about himself in front of Phoenix (until he got directly asked about it and had no other choice).\n\nSo, I'd argue that if Athena were a psychopath that killed her mother out of UR-1 and got enjoyment and pleasure out of it, her telling Phoenix that she wants to become a lawyer to help people would still trigger a bunch of red Psyche Locks because of her willfully lying to Phoenix, so I don't think Phoenix could necessarily get away as being oblivious to Athena's plot here. In other words, Phoenix had to allow for Athena's evil to persist and allowed her to get away with matricide alongside Edgeworth and Udgey for the sake of \"looking good\" at taking down the Dark Age of the Law.\n\nApollo can be totally innocent, though, as his perceptions about Athena were present even as far back as Case 2 and can be tied to UR-1. However, I'm not going to give Phoenix the same benefit of the doubt because of his Magatama.\n\nBut then the question falls back on Athena as to why she'd seek out Phoenix in the first place. In all likelihood, she saw how corrupt Phoenix was in taking down Kristoph Gavin without presenting any legitimate evidence, so that could be why she may have seen a kindred spirit in Phoenix and decided to apply for employment at his agency. But then we've got the Apollo problem to worry about now.\n\nAfter all, why did Apollo punch Phoenix in Case 1 and then seemingly forget about his forgery and became best buddies with him afterward? Is Apollo also a psychopath who got pleasure in taking down Kristoph Gavin, a possibly innocent man?\n\nAlso, is Trucy a psychopath for knowingly presenting Apollo forged evidence as a teenager and Phoenix forged evidence as a child? Did she secretly enjoy Phoenix murdering her father Zak and pinning it on Kristoph?\n\nEdit: About the Gustavia point, why didn't Athena just...wait it out in Germany for a few more years? I mean, it's not like the statute of limitations still wouldn't expire even if Simon were still in prison (or somehow even got declared not guilty). Statute of limitations comes down to how long the crime takes before someone can be tried for it, so if that expired, Athena would be in the clear no matter what anybody else wanted to do to her. If she really wanted to get away with UR-1, waiting it out in Germany is a way safer bet than hoping that Phoenix Wright won't sell her up the river in my eyes.", "But your argument about Magatama does not work because the DLC episode said that it was not used prior. Meaning,\u00a0Athena got the time and information to learn that Magatama works only on those with certain emotional state and when cornered by Phoenix. She did not only get psychologically better, but also her personality type flipped, which should not be possible according to the Jungian type theory, and that is telling.", "Okay, let's throw the Magatama out of the picture then and just consider Phoenix Wright's shadiness as the Forgin' Attorney in general, and how he's really good at telling when someone's bluffing him. Trucy even makes mention of this in AJ, I believe.\n\nPhoenix would know even without a Magatama if Athena were bullshitting him. Sure, she could have practiced psychological techniques for years. But why go to all that trouble to pit herself against Phoenix Wright when she could have simply waited out the [statute of limitations](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Statute_of_limitations) for her mother's murder? What the hell was she even worried about, or did Athena just want a cheap thrill by besting Phoenix Wright?", "But in the game itself, it was shown that Athena successfully lied to Phoenix about her not being involved with the Cosmos Space Center. It was also before her getting arrested, which was only due to Phantom's actions. And that was part of her plan, precisely because she could not have known that she would meet Phoenix overseas. Because he would certainly remember her.", "Well, I suppose that is up to interpretation based on our point of reference, though, isn't it? After all, from whose perspective were we looking at when Athena stated to Phoenix her involvement with Cosmos Space Center?\n\nIt was Phoenix himself, right?\n\nThere's also a bit of a trope in games where the narrator is hiding stuff from the audience, so it wouldn't be much of a stretch here for Phoenix to be aware of Athena's deception while at the same time not making it obvious to ourselves. After all, did we as the audience see Phoenix's face or thoughts upon being told this? And even if he had certain thoughts about what she said, was he also thinking other thoughts that were not shown to us? As a matter of fact, can we say that the game always shows us every acting protagonist's thought process at all times?\n\nSo, in other words, I'm not sure if it can be concretely stated whether Athena got away with that lie or not. Phoenix could have pretended to be aloof and overlook this from Athena, for all we know.\n\nAlso, I would argue here that Phoenix does think things that aren't obvious to us. For instance, we see cutscenes where his thoughts aren't shown, but he has reactions to events like Apollo leaving the agency. There are points in time where Phoenix's own thoughts are not made apparent to us.\n\nMaybe Athena even said that to Phoenix as part of a staged conversation in case a police official were nearby. Isn't that also a possibility?", "What really matters is that Athena conscientiously hides information about her actions and her involvement, and that she is willing to lie about it. Meaning, when she witnesses herself that Simon is still alive, she continues with her plan of pretending that she's helping him. More than six months passes from the time when she returned from overseas, and for all of this time she still purposefully hides the information.", "Okay, so she hid a part of her past that she didn't want to talk about it, and maybe Phoenix and Apollo both figured it out in their own ways.\n\nI'd still argue she didn't conscientiously hide the information about the murder (as nobody ever directly asked her about said murder), but rather her connection to the space center. Those are two very different things, and if Phoenix or Apollo really gave two craps, they could easily look into her background and figure out that she was connected to said space center and that her mother got murdered there. It's not as though Apollo couldn't have looked at pictures of his friend Clay (whom he should have kept in touch with from my understanding) and seen that...\"Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Wright. Clay sent me this photo. Isn't this Athena as a little girl?\" It's not exactly as though this was a state-secret or anything like that.\n\nAnd just because Athena lied to Phoenix and Apollo for months about her involvement with Cosmos Space Center doesn't automatically make her into a psychopath who's been meticulously planning out a crime for months. A crime that doesn't even make much sense when considering she could have simply waited out the statute of limitations in Germany.\n\nAfter all, there's no golden rule saying that Athena is obligated to leave Germany just because she met Phoenix Wright overseas. I'd argue that her leaving Germany essentially takes away Athena's agency if she were only looking out for her best-interest as a psychopath. Last I checked, psychopaths don't exactly like to be in situations that they have no absolute control over the outcome, so I fail to see how a psychopathic Athena would do anything like what she did in the game.\n\nI will grant you the point on Athena's lie to Phoenix in light of the Magatama regarding her connection Cosmos Space Center. But Phoenix still had his Magatama on him, and even if it wasn't used, it's a sign to me that the writers blatantly missed a Psyche Lock situation with Phoenix and Athena, rather than a sign that Athena's behind some grand-master plan that goes above even Phoenix's head. That or the Magatama wasn't charged, but if Phoenix still has connections to Pearl, then it confuses me as to why Phoenix didn't have Pearl charge it up again in the DLC case before the Cosmos Space Center case where Athena lies to Phoenix. That's honestly what makes me think the writers may have overlooked this.\n\nBut even still, I fall back to the golden rule on the statute of limitations. There's nothing written in stone saying she needed to go back with Phoenix Wright after he met her overseas. As a matter of fact, it'd give her an alibi if she remained in Germany and the Phantom tried to plant her GYAXA knife she used on him for Clay's murder.\n\nAthena could just shrug when it's brought up that her fingerprints were on the GYAXA knife used in Clay's murder and say, \"Sorry. Don't know anything about that. I'm just hanging out here in Germany. You can check the airport security logs and see that I haven't left here in all these months. Oh, and check Cosmos Space Center logs, while you're at it.\" Then, they check them, find there's nothing suspicious about Athena in this case, and leave things as they are.\n\nThen Aura pulls her whole hostage situation to accuse Athena, but then realizes that Athena didn't even go to the space center and is still international, so then she simply kills Trucy and Co. Hostages, Phoenix cries, and Athena waits out the statute. Aura doesn't get her trial and gets the death penalty alongside Simon.\n\nAlternatively, if by some miracle of God Aura got her trial of UR-1, Athena isn't there to use her Mood Matrix on Simon, so Simon doesn't feel compelled to reveal that he believes Athena killed her mother, and that he was covering for her all this time. Simon gets the death penalty and Athena can sip some margaritas in Germany. The perfect crime with nobody the wiser except for Aura (but nobody really would listen to what she had to say, anyway, because let's be real...she went about things the complete wrong way) and Simon (who wasn't going to squeal unless Athena forced him to do it).", "The thing is when Clay become part of the crew, Athena and Metis would be not there for them to meet each other. The Magatama coincidence actually works because it \"not working\" actually proves that Athena manipulated the outcome. And she had to come back from overseas because the moment she met Phoenix, she had to use this opportunity to avoid suspicions and gain an ally who enabled her to gain information if Simon was still alive. Her being a poor lawyer also supports the notion because it shows she's doing it to cover for herself, and she's forcing herself into it out of necessity.", "Alright, well, I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree on the matter. I respect your opinion, but it seems like we've both come to two completely different conclusions of thought regarding Athena.\n\nFrom my perspective, I feel like you're tunneling in one direction, and everything that could be seen as circumstantial to someone like me stands out in your eyes. And that's totally fine because you bring some valid points, but it also makes me feel like you're completely glossing over my own critical points. I still have yet to receive a satisfactory answer from you for why Athena wouldn't let the statute run out, so that's why I'm going to end this conversation unless you have something more to add on that front.\n\nAppreciate your thoughts, though. I don't mind debating about a character being secretly evil. I personally prefer to entertain with the notion that Larry is the secret bad guy, though, but that's only because I like to make his character more interesting. Also, I like doing that over Athena because Athena's a late-game character (5 games in before she appears) whereas Larry blips in and out throughout most of the games (AJ and DD being the only exceptions).\n\nIf, on some level, you find that your thoughts on Athena make her character more interesting, then all the power to you. I personally would prefer Athena to experience the harsh realities of the Dark Age of the Law and realize that almost everyone around her is actually corrupt, but that's just my personal cup of tea.", "You and others not seeing the bigger picture is exactly making her plan so good in retrospect. Because for you, it's indistinguishable from someone being genuine. But like I said, a part of the plan was solving Dane Gustavias's dilemma, in which he did what you suggested, and he still got caught. Why do you ask? Because he could not have waited for the statute of limitations to pass while being in another country because it would get frozen. The other part was solving the Kristoph Gavin's dilemma of how to get rid of the witness to the committed deeds remotely without raising suspicions. And Athena's way of solving it was to hide in plain sight while pretending to be a defense attorney using psychology.", "Okay, but...again...even if the statute got frozen due to Athena being in Germany, who cares? It's not like anybody was forcing her to go back into that country where she hypothetically killed her mom.\n\nThere's no \"Gustavia dilemma\" to solve if Athena straight up ignored going back into the country where she committed the crime, especially if she knew that being caught for it was going to put her through the ringer. And I'm pretty sure if she were really curious, she could've gotten a VPN to access the Japanifornian internet to confirm that...yes...Simon Blackquill did in fact get executed for the UR-1 Incident so that she could go back if she really wanted to. Then the statute can run out without anybody knowing about it.\n\nAnd honestly, about Gustavia, the man wouldn't have been caught if he straight-up didn't go snooping around the sculptures. The dude got caught precisely because he got too paranoid (which is precisely what you're arguing would motivate Athena to do this kinda crazy stunt in the first place). The statute of limitations was literally a gift from God granted to Miles and Ray so they didn't feel like shit about letting him walk. In other words, the statute of limitations doesn't get a criminal caught. It's just a hail Mary tactic for lawyers and prosecutors who fucked up the first time. And guess what? If nobody realized they fucked up by executing Simon, Athena could come back after chilling in Germany without any repercussions. You clearly want to ignore this possibility, though, because it's detrimental to your glass house of a theory when you try to assert \"statute of limitations will freeze\" like it somehow motivates someone to leave a safe haven for someplace dangerous for tangential reasons that don't even relate (unless the person REALLY knows what they're doing, but Athena would have had to rely on Phoenix randomly not having a Magatama, Apollo not calling her out on BS, Trucy not calling her out on BS, hell...even JINXIE FREAKING TENMA not calling her out on BS, and her own old friend Juniper Woods who's studying to be a FREAKING JUDGE). I'm sorry, but I've reached my limit when you want to label all of these people like they have no agency whatsoever and Athena is some grand mastermind behind everything (when...literally...she has only been involved in like...what? Four cases? And also the fact that there isn't any sliver of evidence from the games where you can find these kinds of connections unless you want to keep screaming \"GYAXA KNIFE\" over and over expecting me to \"get it\" or something).\n\nI mean, consider why people in OUR world flee to foreign countries after committing crimes. Are these people (some of them psychopaths) just stupid for not trying to setup a complex plan like the one you propose Athena did because they don't want to run out the statute of limitations clock (when they'd probably be fugitives regardless)! Or is some part of them actually intelligent? I'd argue a bit more on the latter side, but I understand why someone would want to roll the dice on the former. But most people don't like gambling with their lives.\n\nAlso, if she were a psychopath, confessing to the crime as a kid would have made more sense than waiting to age-up and be tried for it like an adult.\n\nAnd you're still not listening to my concerns, I feel. I considered everything that you said. Just because I don't agree with you doesn't mean that I'm not seeing the bigger picture, or that I'm \"lacking\" in knowledge.\n\nI understand and respect people who can look deeper into things, but part of wisdom is knowing when to take a step back and realize that...no...actually, you don't know for certain whether Athena is good or evil, and that's perfectly okay.\n\nBut if you feel so strongly about how \"right\" you are, go and make a fan theory of your own and see if others want to debate you on it further. But I'm done now.", "In retrospect, that comment of mine was probably a bit harsh. I will admit that I\u2019ve got some personal bias here because I like to see the good in Athena\u2019s character.\n\nI tend to think of Athena as someone who tries to triumph over her trauma rather than someone who wants to bury it or cackle like a cartoonish villain in the darkness, but that\u2019s just me.\n\nIn any case, I apologize for lashing out in that last comment. It was mostly me venting my frustrations, but that isn\u2019t healthy for me to do in the first place.", "I can admit that it may look like the solution was easy, meaning that Athena does not return. But Gustavias's mistake was that he did not care enough about maintaining his good image. Even if statute of limitations run out or was not a thing it would not matter for the common people, and it was shown many times that Athena does care about her public image. And it was also shown that fake acquittal is worth the sacrifice more than getting the deserved verdict, regardless of the context. So, the solution to that dilemma is to gain experience quickly and return even quicker, which she does.\n\n\nAfter the DLC episode, Magatama does work. Until then, Athena gets enough time to learn about it and prepare for it. But she could not have prepared for the black Psyche Locks because they simply show that the culprit is aware of their involvement and their self-preservation instinct binds them to lying. Apollo doesn't care about it because he's already suspicious of her, but that's only thanks to The Phantom leaving the GYAXA utility knife on Clay's body, which does subconsciously trigger her ticks.\n\n\nNotice that all of those events only occurred because she could not have fully prepared for them. If they didn't happen, Simon would have been already executed! She uses Wright in the same way Simon Keyes uses Miles Edgeworth because in both cases they get their help because of sympathy while them getting into this should be suspicious enough.", "Black psyche locks don\u2019t show conscious awareness, though. At least, that\u2019s not what Phoenix says. He says the person is unconsciously keeping something from themselves. In other words, Athena is suppressing the traumatic experience of her stabbing the Phantom. She also felt that because she suppressed this that she also may have murdered her own mother.\n\nAnd just because Kristoph had black psyche locks, too, and Kristoph was labeled an evil man by Phoenix doesn\u2019t mean even Kristoph had awareness of why he was suppressing something from himself.\n\nMaybe Kristoph believed that somehow the law would step in and evidence (or the lack of evidence on his crime) would prevail over all else. Maybe he was suppressing his complete and total hatred for Wright. But once Wright proved to him that, no, the court system will screw you over on my own say-so for just this one case, that broke Kristoph Gavin\u2019s psyche locks in the worst way possible, and Phoenix had to have known that because his Magatama was active in AJ.\n\nOr are you going to argue that despite Wright\u2019s Magatama being active in the MASON system when he sees Kristoph in solitary in AJ, that Kristoph somehow stole it before his breakdown? Okay, but then when would Phoenix have realized and got it back before the events of SOJ?\n\nYou can\u2019t argue Phoenix is totally oblivious to Athena\u2019s truth behind her black psyche locks when Phoenix has to have seen a man\u2019s mind breakdown and watch spiritual stuff behind the scenes that not even Apollo, the Judge, or Klavier could see. That makes Phoenix the psychopath and not Athena, I would argue.\n\nNow you can call Kristoph a monster all day long just like Athena. But I feel like it\u2019s important for you to understand that Kristoph and Athena both went through mental trauma by means of psychotic breaks. You can see it in the way they both talk.\n\nAthena is shaking, and the game of Dual Destinies is rated Mature for a reason because of Athena\u2019s whole story surrounding her mother\u2019s murder to begin with.\n\nIf you\u2019re arguing that the developers deliberately slipped in something like a psychotic child murderer beneath the veil of the whole story, then I\u2019d argue that your mindset has become a bit warped in this regard.\n\nAthena may have been psychotic due to mental trauma. But psychosis is different than psychopathy. One is something that someone can develop due to experiencing severe trauma, and the other is something one is born with.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re going to argue Athena is a psychopath and knew about her black psyche locks and how to break them in court despite Phoenix somehow thinking they were her unconscious lies to herself, (or that somehow black psyche locks are indicative of a person hiding their psychopathy) then please explain to me coherently and logically (i.e. not by acting like you\u2019re the only one with exclusive knowledge) how Athena\u2019s could be seen breaking by Phoenix in court, and how that also proves that Athena did not have full control over Wright\u2019s Magatama and that it was in fact still active in DD like you originally assert.\n\nAlso, people lie to Phoenix all the time in the games when his Magatama is still active. I think the whole Magatama mechanic is hokey itself to begin with because people hide key plot points from Phoenix. Matt Engarde should have had Psyche Locks appear every other word, imo, but they didn\u2019t because that would take away the mystery and the fact that Phoenix could get duped for the sake of story.\n\nIn other words, Phoenix\u2019s Magatama screws over your theory just like any other unless you assume Phoenix is a malevolent force like Athena, which you aren\u2019t.", "Your interpretation of black Psyche Locks not matter because both Kristoph and Athena know of their involvement and that's why they trigger. It's obvious that, Kristoph having the infamous yellow envelope is enough proof against him. And also, Athena having a disdain for her mother is similarly compelling. And if you still insist that it was through her unconscious, then you actually support my notion. She successfully lies to Phoenix without triggering the regular Psyche Locks. Why? Because she consciously avoids being cornered by him, which would have triggered them.", "K. Your interpretation doesn't matter to me because it's obvious to me that you've lost the plot and not making coherent sense anymore with your theory. Sorry, but I'm done now. You've officially lost the plot by not explaining what Black Psyche Locks vs Red Psyche Locks mean.\n\nBy your own logic, all Ace Attorney killers lying to Phoenix should also have their own sets of black Psyche Locks as they're aware of their own involvement in their crimes like Kristoph and Athena, but this is obviously objectively not the case in the Ace Attorney series, so you just invalidated your own argument against Athena with your own argument about her and Kristoph handling around their black Psyche Locks.\n\nGood game. We're officially done now. You just invalidated your own theory in an attempt to validate it, which is proof that you're just talking nonsense to me at this point. Sayonara, troll.", "Technically, that was not a mistake because black Psyche Locks are built upon the 5 red ones and so on. Meaning, the black ones inherit the properties of the red ones. And what I could have done was to add more detail to explain my argument more clearly.\u00a0"], "URLs": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/13049et/ace_attorney_the_possibility_of_grossberg/)", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom?so=search)", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Ga'ran_Sigatar_Khura'in?so=search),", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Kee'ra)'s", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_Hammond),", "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131g0ul/ace_attorney_the_true_essence_of_dahlia/),", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Celeste_Inpax)", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Damon_Gant?so=search),", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Amano_Group?so=search)", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Cohdopian_smuggling_ring),", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Yatagarasu).", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Shih-na),", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Manny_Coachen?so=search),", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/John_Marsh?so=search)", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Dee_Vasquez).", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Dai-Long_Lang),", "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12zgcd4/ace_attorney_how_phoenix_wrights_alleged_culprit/),"], "html_title": ["r FanTheories comments ace attorney the possibility of grossberg", "Phantom | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Lady Kee'ra)'s | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Robert Hammond), | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "r FanTheories comments ace attorney the true essence of dahlia", "Celeste Inpax) | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Damon Gant | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Amano Group | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Cohdopian smuggling ring), | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Yatagarasu). | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Shih-na), | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Manny Coachen | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "John Marsh | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Dee Vasquez). | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Dai-Long Lang), | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "r FanTheories comments ace attorney how phoenix wrights alleged culprit"]},{"title": "My MCU Theory: We will finally get the introduction of a new heroine in GOTG Vol 3 that was first mentioned in GOTG Vol 1 and later in Avengers: Infinity War", "selftext": "\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5 POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\n\nTHE DAUGHTER OF DRAX IS ALIVE AND I CAN PROVE IT \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5TLDR WARNING\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5 (I promise it's worth the time \ud83e\udd13)\n\nI play the mobile game Marvel Contest of Champions and a new playable character is being introduced in to the game with May's update that is not currently in the MCU. With literally 1 or 2 exceptions, all of those exceptions taking place early on closer to when the game was first released, over the past almost 10 years I've been playing this game when a Marvel Studios movie or show is released Kabam also introduces two characters from that movie or show into the game. This month we are getting The High Evolutionary and Moondragon. In February we got Stature and Ant-Man 2099 when Quantumania was released. Last December we got Mantis when The GOTG Holiday Special Presentation was released. Last November we got Shuri and Attuma when BP:WF was released. Last July we got Gorr and Valkyrie when Thor Love and Thunder was released. Last April we got Wong and Rintrah when Dr Strange MOM was released. In October of 2021 we got Sersi and Ikaris when Eternals was released. I don't think I need to keep going but just to let you know I definitely could. I can go back through almost 10 full years of this game to prove to you this is what they do. Now before I get to my actual theory and go about proving it with supporting facts we need to start at the beginning so y'all have some context.\n\nFirst some back story:\n\nThanos:\nIn his quest to collect the Infinity Stones in order to balance the universe Thanos sent Ronan to Drax's planet. Look at all of Drax's natural abilities. He doesn't have any superhuman Powers. The abilities he possesses are natural to his race. He comes from a warrior race. Claimed his people fought back against Thanos and Thanos wiped out half of his people including his wife and daughter. Drax mentioned in GOTG Vol 1 that he's on a quest to kill Ronan and Thanos in order to avenge the deaths of his family and his people. Doesn't this sound familiar? Doesn't this sound exactly like what happened to Gamora and Nebula? I believe Gamora and Nebula are the last surviving members of their respective races. Thanos planned to only kill 50% of their respective races but I believe he ended up killing everyone on their respective planets. This happened because they chose to fight back. Thanos saved Gamora. Thanos saved Nebula. I believe Thanos did that because he didn't condone genocide, he didn't view himself as a villain. He wasn't there to extinguish all life. Just half of it in his quest to balance the universe. Condoning genocide would mark him a villain so he left one member of each of their respective races alive in order justify to himself that he's not a villain and that he's doing what must be done ultimately for the benefit of everyone in the universe. \n\nHigh Evolutionary:\nI believe the High Evolutionary was the previous owner of Knowhere before the Collector and he was harvesting its body to aid him in his experiments because Knowhere is the husk of a dead Celestial. After he was done stripping it of the resources he wanted, The High Evolutionary sold what was left over to The Collector. What did The Collector use for payment in order to secure Knowhere? What could possibly peak the interest of The High Evolutionary and convince him to sell Knowhere to The Collector? Hmmm... \ud83e\udd14\n\nThe Collector:\nHe's got a thing for rare species and objects. In GOTG Vol 1 when Gamora met The Collector he mentioned that it was nice to finally meet her in the flesh. This means they have conversed before but not in person. He was also quite smitten by her and I believe this is because she is the last of her race and he wants her for part of his collection. He even tried to make a deal with Groot to procure Groot's body after his death. I believe Gamora and The Collector knew each other because Gamora contacted him after deciding not to give Thanos the location of the Soul Stone in order to ensure The Collector didn't give it to him either. The Collector would have looked at the map and known where the Soul Stone was. After Thanos took one of the infinity stones from The Collector on Knowhere during Avengers Infinity War, The Collector survived and later sold Knowhere to the Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nBack to the High Evolutionary:\nThat man is obsessed with perfecting life in the universe in order to create the perfect being. That means he needs to perform experiments. You can't tell me The High Evolutionary would not be interested in a naturally occurring species where everybody on the planet has superhuman strength, durability, endurance and stamina. Not to mention accelerated healing and an extremely high metabolism. I believe all of the male members of Drax's race naturally possess these physical abilities and I also believe that all of the female members of Drax's race have a perfect mind instead of a perfect body. Interesting huh.... \ud83d\ude43\n\nNow here is my theory:\n\n1) When Thanos decimated Drax's planet trying to balance the universe, prior to gathering the infinity stones, prior to the formation of the Guardians of the Galaxy, prior to The Collector owning Knowhere, Moondragon survived. Like Nebula and Gamora, Thanos allowed Moondragon to survive so that her race would live on and he would not be guilty of genocide. Thanos was completely unaware Drax was alive because he must have been off planet as we know Drax was not present on his planet when his family was murdered by Ronan. Drax did not watch his family die. Ronan never met him before GOTG Vol 1. I believe Thanos kept Moondragon alive just like he kept Gamora and Nebula alive because although he was slaughtering people across the universe in order to cut the population in half to bring balance to the universe, he was not out to commit Genocide. By keeping one member alive of each of the races that fought against his plans to bring balance to the universe he insured that their species would live on and  \"thrive\" in the universe that would result after he was done with his mission.\n\n2) Later Thanos had Ronan confront The Collector, before The Collector purchased Knowhere from The High Evolutionary, in his search for the Infinity Stones. The Collector gave Ronan that information. So what did Thanos have Ronan give to the collector to secure that information? \ud83e\udd14 I believe Thanos has Ronan trade Moondragon to The Collector for information pertaining to the location of the Infinity Stones because, to The Collector, Moondragon would be the last of her race and a prized trophy in his collection. The Collector gave Ronan the map to the Soul Stone which he then gave to Nebula and Gamora so they could retrieve it. Gamora and Nebula as we know decided not to give Thanos the location of the Soul Stone and lied to him. Then ultimately Gamora took off running. That's where we met her at the beginning of Guardians of the Galaxy vol 1.\n\n3) Then the Collector (Again prior to GOTG Vol 1) met up with the High Evolutionary because he needed storage space for his collection and Knowhere didn't just house his collection, it was actually a part of his collection because Knowhere is the body of a dead Celestial. So what did The Collector give the High Evolutionary in order to secure Knowhere? Why Moondragon of course.\n\n4) The Collector traded Moondragon for Knowhere. The High Evolutionary is on a mission to create the perfect being through experimentation. Of course he's going to be interested in the last surviving member of a species where all the women had perfected their mental capabilities and all the men had perfected their physical capabilities. However he only has a female member of Drax's species. Remember nobody knew Drax was alive because he was not there when Thanos destroyed his planet and race. However his experiments on Moondragon would have given him the knowledge to disable Drax's abilities which was shown to be something he is able to do in the trailer when the little girl threw a rock at his head and Drax felt it. The last time we saw Drax he was laughing off bullets to the face and chest in The GOTG Holiday Special. So why/how else could a simple rock hurt him where as bullets tickled him?\n\n5) Moondragon is the intended mate of Warlock. So in the comics Warlock was known as Him and was created by the collective. Later they created another perfect being but this time a female and she was known as Her. Later on she was referred to as The Goddess. We've already met The Goddess. I don't believe Ayesha is going to be Warlock's mate in the MCU so he still needs one. \n\nThe following is a list of Moondragon's abilities that I copied literally from Marvel wiki:\n\nAbilities:\n\nPsionics: Heather Douglas is an extraordinary telepath, most notable during her complete mental enslavement of an entire warring planet of people. Douglas' mental psionic powers include:\n\nTelepathy: Douglas possesses the ability to contact sentient minds both organic and mechanical based, as well as cosmic beings such as Galactus. Her telepathic abilities include mind-control, mental attacks, mental shielding, personality alteration, memory erasure, memory modification. Douglas telepathic range is almost limitless, as she is able to contact minds across a solar system without enhancement devices such as Xavier's Cerebro\n\nTelekinesis: Douglas's telekinetic range is low to moderate as she can only demonstrated the ability to levitate herself and a few others at the same time. Douglas can \"push\" her telekinetic ability on herself to attain flight or use it offensively as powerful concussive blasts.\n\nDragon Form: For a time, Moondragon gained the ability to assume the form of her namesake: A superhumanly strong and durable dragon, capable of faster-than-light speed travel and surviving in outer space without air. It is unknown whether or not she retains this ability.\n\nGenius Scientist: Douglas is an expert in various advanced Titanian sciences as well as Earth human sciences. She was able to give powers to Ramrod and Angar the Screamer, and was able to give Daredevil his eyesight back.\n\nMaster Martial Artist: Douglas is a superb alien hand-to-hand combatant, trained by the Titanian monks of Shao-Lom who were veteran practitioners in martial arts. Having trained herself to be as strong as one of her size and weight can be without having superhuman strength, Douglas is well versed in pressure points. And she has even defeated Mantis, Psylocke, and Captain America in hand-to-hand combat.\n\nAviation: Douglas is a skilled starship pilot.\n\nNervous System Control: Mental and physical disciplines gave her improved control over her autonomic body functions, including those of heartbeat, bleeding, breathing, and pain reception.\n\nWeaknesses\nMost of Douglas' superhuman abilities are based on her ability to concentrate. If Douglas is distracted or unable to focus her mind to accomplish an event, she can be rendered completely mentally powerless, as shown when Rick Jones held her captive with a pair of headphones pumping heavy metal tracks.\n\nAlso this is super interesting:\nShe was stated to have a \"planetary\" threat level by the Nova Corps \ud83d\ude43\n\nKey take aways:\n1) Moondragon AKA Kamaria is alive.\n\n2) Gamora and Nebula are partially responsible for Moondragon ending up in the clutches of the High Evolutionary. I believe Ronan traded Moondragon to The Collector for the map that led to the location of the Soul Stone. The map was then given to Nebula and Gamora so they could procure the infinity stone for Thanos by Ronan. As we all know, they found the Soul Stone but decided not to give the information to Thanos and told him it wasn't there.\n\n3) Gamora and Nebula so far have never said a word to Drax about it. Could be that they haven't made the connection yet and are completely unaware that it was his daughter or they may be unaware as to how Ronan procured the map to the Soul Stone from The Collector.\n\n4) The High Evolutionary is on a mission to create the perfect race. Once this is done he intends to wipe out all life in the universe except Him and Her (Warlock and Moondragon) so that he can repopulate the universe with a perfect race of beings in a new universe free of genetic defects and impurities leaving The High Evolutionary in charge for the rest of eternity.\n\nNotes: \n\n1) Gamora's race was believed to only be reduced to 50% but it was later revealed that she was the last of her species so I believe that the remaining 50% continued to fight back against Thanos and his army and they ended up wiping out the entire planet as a result with the exception of Gamora. I believe this also happened with Drax and Nebula's respective races.\n\n2) Kamaria is Drax's daughters name in the MCU. In Marvel Comics she was raised by priests on Titan. In the comics, Drax's daughter is Heather Douglas, better known as Moondragon. In the Swahili language, Kamaria means \"like the moon\".\n\n3) Drax was not there when his family was killed so I'm assuming he was off planet. If he was there he would have been killed. In GOTG Vol 1 when Drax first fought Ronan he was easily bested/defeated by Ronan.\n\nI have never ever posted a theory anywhere on social media but I feel so strongly about this I thought it was important that I shared it. Regardless of whether or not my theory is correct, it will definitely provoke conversation and that's ultimately what makes Redditt so great. \ud83d\ude0a", "id": "131822p", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131822p/my_mcu_theory_we_will_finally_get_the/", "created_utc": 1682631369.0, "score": 3, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/131822p/my_mcu_theory_we_will_finally_get_the/", "comments": ["This is in desperate need of a TLDR", "Thanks for sharing you\u2019re theory.

How can you deny it when the proof is right in front of you bro?", "Also yeah that's what The High Evolutionary wants to do. He wants to create the perfect race and repopulate the universe with it. The only problem is that he wants to exterminate all other life in the universe because he views it as flawed in order to attain his goals.", "Just a quick one or two sentence topic sentence or thesis at the bottom or top that summarizes your theory encourages people who might otherwise not read the wall of text to give it a shot.", "Man how can anyone say Thanos is still a sympathetic villain at this point?

Thanos either lied which is the most probable scenario or something really bad happened to her people after Thanos left but why would he say they thrived if they are all dead so he lied.

After waking up from a violent encounter, he finds himself in the care of the people responsible. He asks, \u201cam I dead?\u201d Which I believe he very much is (or is in the process of during the course of the movie.) \n\nMultiple studies have shown that during death, the brain will flood itself with hallucinogenic DMT in its final moments, hence the surreal and psychedelic nature of Beau\u2019s journey. It also explains how the traveling theatre group\u2019s play mirrors his life so closely, it\u2019s *his* mind. The play isn\u2019t just him describing the main difficulties of his life but is also a subconscious wish that things had turned out different (having children, a family.) It also explains why the film is structured the way it is with flashbacks to his youth interspersed throughout.\n\nBeau is simultaneously revisiting formative past memories whilst breaking down the deepest and darkest thoughts that have been buried within his mind his whole life, his life is literally flashing before his eyes. No, his mother did not stage an elaborate fake death or pay Beau\u2019s therapist for years to tell her what Beau said during therapy. That\u2019s why she has those tapes, it\u2019s *Beau\u2019s* mind.\n\nIt also explains the giant dick monster in the attic, and the chained \u201cbraver\u201d version of himself. Beau feels as though his mother has had these aspects of himself chained as a child and that he never had them his whole life, his bravery being his doppelg\u00e4nger, his sexual urges and masculinity being the monster. This theory also accounts for the general tone of the movie.\n\nBeau is a very anxious man that takes medication for said anxiety. It has been with him for the entirety of his life, stemming from when he was a child. It makes sense that a man like him, in his final moments inside his dying brain, soaked with hallucinogenic chemicals, would have a disturbing, uncomfortable, tense trip. Even the first quarter of the movie is explained by his anxiety.\n\nThe reason why Beau appears to live in a hell scape of a city where dead corpses are seemingly left in the street to rot is his anxiety heightening his perception of his already scary neighborhood. So when the local news says \u201cman stabs 3 people in park\u201d Beau hears \u201cman stabs 28 in serial stabbing.\u201d So the movie is broken in two pieces. One told from his anxiety ridden mind and the rest which is his dying mind. *All* of this is anchored by one thing: Ari Aster\u2019s love of tragedy. \n\nFrom Aster\u2019s previous outings: Hereditary and Midsommer it\u2019s clear that he enjoys telling stories that are tragic in nature and if this theory is true *if* Then the whole story is summed up as a man, (Beau) on the worst day of his life after being locked out of his apartment and forced to sleep outside, learning that his mother dies in a tragic accident, cries for hours, runs off scared naked in the street, a police officer refusing to help him, gets hit by a *truck* then is *stabbed* to *death* by a homeless man, dies a virgin and in his final moments pieces together in his subconscious how the entirety of his life shaped out the way it did.

There would have been much less risk for Redd to have done this, actually, so it confuses me on why this wasn't done if Redd actually had such a pull on Marvin in the first place.\n\nThat's why I imagine the possibility of turning the situation around since the current assumption about Grossberg being blackmailed leads to oddities, especially given how Redd is supposedly a powerful source for intimidating Grossberg into not telling Mia pertinent information.\n\nWhat if Grossberg wasn't the one who was offered riches by Redd White, but rather, Grossberg helped back Redd's information conglomerate by giving him the dirt on all of his top clients, including Misty Fey among the names he revealed to Redd? What if Grossberg actually was a part of what made Redd White into the arrogant, smarmy ass that he was, and then Grossberg threatened to upend all of that by having Mia look through his files (which most likely contained the information Mia used to build up her case against Redd White)?\n\nAs for why Redd was listening in on Mia's conversations with Maya? Namely, Redd was hoping that he'd be able to find some dirt on Grossberg from Mia so he could respond back to the threats of his operation being uncovered because of Grossberg's double-dipping with himself and Mia.\n\nAlso, let's consider Redd's list of names for a second. Why the hell would the man flip out over the names of the people he blackmailed being revealed by Mia? After all, he could simply give a fake million-dollar smile and say, \"So what, Mr. Wrong? You clearly can't touch me, and neither can those people.\"\n\nBut what if the list of names were not the names of people that White was blackmailing, but rather, a list of people who asked him for information on other people, or aspiring blackmailers? In other words, Redd didn't have the keys to the kingdom, but was rather an actual information network for these blackmailers to gain access to their information. Redd needed to value these blackmailers' secrets with his life, otherwise, he'd be killed.  I mean...if word got out that the Minister of Justice (I believe that's  the first name) was blackmailing someone, the courts would go apeshit.  Honestly, it would not even surprise me if someone like Matt Engarde was  on that list, since according to the wiki page on it, [Mia's memo](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Mia%27s_Memo) mentions celebrities that Phoenix knew about. \n\nAnd I'm willing to bet that Grossberg knew these inconvenient truths  about Redd White's operation, which is probably why he had them in some  of his files (which Mia probably got ahold of). So Grossberg didn't have  any real reason to give his painting to Redd White. Honestly,  Grossberg's painting probably had a bug on it, and Grossberg was keeping  his own tabs on Redd's conversations to make sure that the man wouldn't  spill his own blackmailing tendencies.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the fact that Marvin Grossberg was known to be very close to the Fey family. He was a mentor to Mia and even took her in as an apprentice despite the controversy surrounding her mother's case. It seems unlikely that he would betray Mia and her family so easily without some kind of ulterior motive.\n\nPerhaps Grossberg saw an opportunity to benefit from both sides - on one hand, he could provide Redd White with valuable information from his clients and on the other hand, he could use Mia's investigative skills to uncover any potential threats to his own interests.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Grossberg was deeply involved in the legal industry, and would likely have had access to a lot of confidential information that could be used for blackmail purposes. This could explain why Redd White was so interested in getting his hands on the list of names that Mia had uncovered, not necessarily only because some of it was information to blackmail people on, but because he would have had the opportunity to establish a repertoire with some political connections that he could add to his own information conglomerate. So long as Redd would have kept these secrets safe in his operation, he'd be untouchable because these people would have had his back.\n\nOf course, all of this is just speculation and there's no concrete evidence to support any of these theories. But it's certainly an interesting way to look at the events that led up to Mia's death and the role that Grossberg may have played in it in addition to Redd White.", "id": "13049et", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/13049et/ace_attorney_the_possibility_of_grossberg/", "created_utc": 1682554507.0, "score": 142, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/13049et/ace_attorney_the_possibility_of_grossberg/", "comments": ["Lol.

This suggests that Grossberg\u2019s act in helping Mia may not have been as benevolent as we would like to believe, especially considering how Maya is refused council by Grossberg after Phoenix asks him, and Maya said she heard that Grossberg would be able to help her in court from her sister Mia. Grossberg acting duplicitous against Mia once could be coincidence, but two times suggests a kind of pattern to Grossberg\u2019s mindset that needs further exploration.\n\nI\u2019d also add that my theory highlights the notion that Grossberg could want Mia to think he truly regrets his corrupt actions to get her to not look into him further. He supplies her with files incriminating the man in the middle, Redd White, as the one blackmailing everyone so that she\u2019d stop her investigations at Redd White only.\n\nBut Redd\u2019s inconsistencies around his confession when Mia/Phoenix read off the list should have highlighted something big about his character that was being overlooked. Redd may have used his influence to blackmail people, sure, but in terms of his connections, Redd probably knew that he was a small fry if his bigger network connections ever got disrupted or revealed in court, which was most likely corrupted per the [shadow network](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131dftt/ace_attorney_the_redd_white_and_grossberg/), hence his confession.", "They're messing with you.

This would imply that Zak had the motive and means to kill Drew and frame Kristoph for the crime.\n\nIt should also be noted that Vera receiving a poisoned nail polish bottle similar to Kristoph's is circumstantial at best. It is possible that Zak could have easily had a similar pink nail polish bottle that either his  daughter Trucy or his wife Thalassa had received from him as a gift.  The nail polish bottle might have been given to Vera by Zak to frame  Kristoph and deflect suspicion from himself. Zak could have also seen Kristoph putting nail polish on during one of his hypothetical meetings with his mentor, Magnifi, after Thalassa's accident. It should also be noted that since Kristoph was a fan of the Gramarye performances that such a notion is not outside the realm of possibility regarding Kristoph's character.\n\nMoreover, Zak could have known about Kristoph prior to meeting him in the Detention Center following Zak's arrest for killing Magnifi, Zak's father-in-law. This could have happened due to a probate law case Kristoph could have taken upon request by Magnifi following Thalassa's accident.\n\nThe theory suggests that Zak could have killed Magnifi by giving him some morphine to knock him unconscious or upon Magnifi's request and hide in his bed or in a closet in the room. Then Valant shows up, talks with Magnifi, and then after Valant leaves the room, Zak kills Magnifi, rips out the diary page indicating Magnifi's choice, and flees before Valant goes back into the room, leaving either Valant's gun or his own on Magnifi's bedside where Valant left a gun.\n\nZak gives the diary page to Vera while disguised as Gavin to complete the forgery and make Vera not suspect Zak himself for the crimes. Zak then plans his escape from court because he knows Wright will present forged evidence that he gave to his daughter Trucy beforehand to give to Wright at his trial.\n\nFast-forward to years later when Wright meets Zak again, Zak gives Wright his confession indicating that he actually did murder Magnifi. Wright purposely buries this confession, but he did not necessarily have to. However, Wright does contact Vera for forged evidence such as the bloody ace to get Gavin convicted for killing Zak, so it's possible Wright and Zak actually did have a falling out.\n\nThe theory argues that even Wright could have easily killed Zak over Kristoph because outside of a forged piece of evidence and a description about Zak being bald, there was nothing placing Kristoph at the scene. Kristoph could have easily have seen Zak as bald when he attempted to defend the man in Magnifi's murder trial before Wright took on the case. Moreover, Wright's MASON system indicates that Wright should have had the foreknowledge to stop Drew from being murdered and Vera from almost being murdered if he really wanted to.\n\nTherefore, the theory suggests that Kristoph Gavin might have been falsely accused and convicted of the crimes, while Phoenix Wright and Zak Gramarye could have been the real culprits all along. In addition, Gavin's breakdown in court regarding the law and how he is told that he is no longer needed anymore by his own brother shows exactly how pervasive the [Dark Age of the Law](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131dftt/ace_attorney_the_redd_white_and_grossberg/) was even before Dual Destinies.", "id": "12zgcd4", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12zgcd4/ace_attorney_how_phoenix_wrights_alleged_culprit/", "created_utc": 1682512903.0, "score": 14, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/12zgcd4/ace_attorney_how_phoenix_wrights_alleged_culprit/", "comments": ["The only issue that I see with this is the black  psyche locks that Phoenix sees when talking to Kristoph.

Other than, I suppose, the fact that Kristoph *knows* the bloody ace is forged evidence. Only the killer could really know that. Also, I don't recall Vera making the ace for Phoenix. Given how quickly trials go in the Ace Attorney world, it doesn't seem like he'd have time for that. \n\nI believe this is the point of the MASON system and the jury trial in that last case. Kristoph's persona is that evidence is everything and thus if you can get rid of the right evidence or avoid creating it in the first place you can get away with any crime. But the jury can consider nuance and possibilities beyond evidence if they all agree.", "True. I guess as a form of rebuttal I\u2019d argue since that was in Wright\u2019s MASON system, and there are logistical problems with the MASON system in the first place (such as Wright showing Kristoph\u2019s profile to Vera in the past when Wright had no reason to suspect Kristoph then), then one could excuse Kristoph\u2019s black psyche locks.\n\nThey could also represent Kristoph\u2019s unconscious belief that his friend Phoenix Wright or his attempted client Zak Gramarye is actually responsible, but maybe a part that is good in Kristoph is purposely trying to deny this trauma, or it could be Kristoph\u2019s pain about Apollo being turned against him. But those are simply a couple of examples I came up with on the top of my head.", "Good counterpoint. Allow me to offer what I view as a plausible rebuttal on my end.\n\nThe thing about Kristoph knowing a fact can either be active if he\u2019s the killer or passive if he suspects Wright of forgery, though. The difference is the intent behind what Kristoph sees as plausible versus what is actual in reality. Active answers for both cases like you pointed out, but passive doesn\u2019t necessarily have to, so this is where I\u2019ll argue from for this point.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing necessarily indicating that Zak\u2019s murder couldn\u2019t have been premeditated by Wright in an attempt to frame Gavin, from my understanding. This would have given Wright ample time to make the forged Ace, which he exploited with Zak\u2019s blood to setup Gavin.\n\nSure, Gavin flipped out when he saw Apollo present the forged ace, but that could\u2019ve also been because Gavin as the Greatest Defense Attorney in the West could tell when his protege was presenting Wright\u2019s bullshit Ace from a mile away in an attempt to frame him for the murder of Zak Gramarye. Kristoph still wanted to defend Wright for the murder out of obligation to his \u201cfriend\u201d, though, and I believe he even said this before being officially cross-examined.\n\nLet\u2019s do a thought experiment. Imagine you\u2019re Wright, and I\u2019m Gavin. If I\u2019m Gavin, I know if I\u2019m either guilty or innocent. If I\u2019m guilty, and you present the forged Ace incriminating me for my crime, like you argued, I\u2019d flip out and reveal my cards.\n\nBut let\u2019s say that I\u2019m innocent, and you present that bloody Ace to incriminate me for the murder. Now, seeing as to how I, Kristoph Gavin, know myself to be innocent, that makes me wonder how the heck you got an incriminating piece of evidence on me for a crime that I did not actually commit. In other words, I know that you\u2019re forging stuff if I\u2019m innocent. So, like Gavin said Case 1 to Apollo, I\u2019d ask Apollo where the hell he got that Ace from (because I can\u2019t in good conscience allow my protege Apollo to present forged evidence since he\u2019s under my tutelage and could lose his badge! So now Wright\u2019s got me in a sticky situation. I can\u2019t admit that the Ace is a forgery without being able to objectively prove my innocence to the judge or jeopardize my protege Apollo\u2019s career, which I\u2019m unable to do because I\u2019m such a nice guy.)\n\nHowever, if one assumes Kristoph was actually deep down a good guy, one could also argue part of Kristoph just didn\u2019t want to lose faith in his friend Wright until Wright made Kristoph snap in Trial 4, despite Wright clearly making Apollo present forged evidence against him.\n\nOne could even argue this is why Kristoph goes to solitary with a smile on his face. Some part of him might believe that Wright will still let him out, but his black psyche locks know the truth. The truth that Wright is going to sell Kristoph\u2019s innocence to get his defense attorney\u2019s badge back.", "That makes a lot of sense I was going to address this as well in my first response but, with the psychic aspect of the ace attorney series it\u2019s hard to really tell the true reason for the locks as they are the only ones in the series that haven\u2019t been broken meaning no reason for their existence has been cemented compared to say Athena\u2019s locks which were broken when she finally realized the truth about her mothers death.(meaning the black locks were caused by the unresolved trauma she experienced) \n\nIt actually does make sense though like you said that Kristoph would block out what he saw. And if Phoenix did perform the murder then he wouldn\u2019t try to break these locks as that would mean Kristoph would finally have to accept what he knows about Wright according to your theory.(which would in turn make him a witness against him although he has no proof)\n\nI think that your idea is a really interesting concept and I\u2019m impressed with how well thought out it is. I mean the idea itself sounds absurd but, is theoretically possible as some things were never confirmed. \n\nI do kind of wish though that in the game Phoenix had broken the psyche locks in court seeing as it worked well during dual destinies with Athena but, alas that will probably never happen.", "Yeah, unfortunately, that seems likely. I\u2019ve even had some fanfiction ideas in mind for the black psyche locks regarding Athena. She\u2019s the one who\u2019d make the most sense to break them the most out of any attorney in the entire series.\n\nBut honestly, the character change from Phoenix in AJ to DD and SOJ felt so sudden and weird to me. Part of me kinda hopes there\u2019s some dramatic reveal like the fact that Phoenix or someone in the series close to home is a killer, and Athena would be able to break away from Wright Anything Agency (and if Athena somehow got Wright\u2019s Magatama, with her psychoanalytic capabilities, she could help even criminals or traumatized witnesses like she was get over the black psyche locks in a way that\u2019s respectful to their humanity, unlike what AJ Phoenix did to Kristoph\u2026)\n\nBut if I were to put it frankly, I don\u2019t think that Capcom\u2019s got the guts to do that. I think that\u2019s why DD Phoenix even got created in the first place as a divergence from AJ like it never existed. AJ\u2019s treated like a red headed stepchild in the series so much that it\u2019s clear something deeper about Phoenix\u2019s character got snuffed out (because Apollo punches him Case 1 and Case 2 and onward they are buddies like nothing happened, even in DD and SOJ? Meh\u2026sorry. Not buying it. Something smells, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s even the Butz this time\u2026)\n\nWhenever I reflect on AJ Phoenix, Phoenix\u2019s whole character after that now leaves a pretty bitter taste in my mouth. More bitter than Godot\u2019s blends.\n\nAlso, where the hell did Iris go? She was Phoenix\u2019s everything, but we never hear DD or SOJ Phoenix say a peep about going to see her in Detention. It\u2019s not like she murdered people and got executed like some in the series did, but I have my thoughts on even that happening in the first place, so I digress.", "I feel exactly the same way in regards to Phoenixs character shift. The jump from Trials and tribulations to Apollo Justice was really out of the blue and I don\u2019t think capcom expected to continue using Phoenix for as long as they did. Apollo justice was supposed to pass the torch but, that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nIt would have certainly been interesting if he had a realistic fall from grace instead of just a flimsy piece of forged evidence. Like Capcom is afraid to taint the character since he is apparently the backbone of the game franchise. \n\nI think it would have been better had they kept him in the background for DD and SoJ. Sure I like the dynamic between him and Edgeworth and the others characters but, we have there\u2019s games of that already-we gotta move on eventually. \n\nPutting Phoenix in the newer games just shows how hesitant Capcom is to let new characters take the reigns in the games. I mean they always fall back on Phoenix even when his story\u2019s long sense been over.\n\nHe\u2019s a cool enough character but, not when he\u2019s beaten into the ground with game after game. At least with Edgeworth he got his own spin off and they didn\u2019t try to force him down are throats in the later games -except for cameos and DLC which were really more fan service than anything.\n\nWhile I know that the original trilogy happened I feel like the series as a whole went through a sort of revitalization after the lower ratings of Apollo Justice (even though in my opinion the game is good). They did this by bringing back the \u201cold Phoenix\u201d it was like the character he was in Apollo justice didn\u2019t exist. Where is the cynical Ex-lawyer who gambles and wears a freaking beanie. I agree that the character shift isn\u2019t logical.\n\nLike okay he got his lawyer badge back but, he wouldn\u2019t just step back into law his experience would be tainted by his years away from it along with the whole Apollo justice ordeal with Kristoph.\n\nReally in my honest opinion Kristoph didn\u2019t have to be evil but, they wanted to put Apollo with Phoenix to guide fans along and accept this new lawyer that they weren\u2019t yet accustomed to. What would have been an interesting plot is maybe not having Phoenix murder someone but, reveal how he fell from grace and is actually a bad person now after accidentally using forged evidence. That would make Apollo justice better (also the MASON system doesn\u2019t make any sense I\u2019m just going to say it now in reality there was no way Apollo should have been able to solve that case. Give me a prequel case if you want to pull at T&T style story don\u2019t just fudge up the plot into different time lines. Kinda removed me from it a bit.)\n\nand what you said about Iris I didn\u2019t even think of -you\u2019re right they kind of just dropped her like oh yeah Phoenix had feelings for her but, he just ditched her completely meanwhile the second Edgeworth is in jail he comes running.\n\n They definitely should have brought her back or at least brought her up in the later games as she was an important part of his life for a long time similar to Mia who is brought up often enough that you never really forget about her.\n\nSpeaking of what you said about Athena I would love to play a Game centered around her I love the psychology aspect of the cases she\u2019s in and think they did it pretty well. I would read a fan fiction where she confronts Kristoph and breaks his psyche locks for wright.\n\nAlso the ace attorney puns your wrote are amazing.\n\n(Sorry if that sounded a bit scatter brained I had so much I wanted to say and it all came out a bit discombobulated)\n\n(Also hear me out but, Klavier deserved better representation in DD like come on they gave him the -almost-worst case in the game I need him and Kristoph both to come back in something they both have interesting personalities that could play off of the other characters really well. (I mean they have had a case in a prison before)", "This is exactly why there should be an earth-shattering first trial in the next game (not one with a dopey culprit that\u2019s really short) that centers Athena as the defense attorney and Klavier as the prosecutor. Let the two develop a back-and-forth that Klavier should have been able to have with Apollo but never got the chance because Capcom chickened out and wanted to rely on Phoenix so much.\n\nAlso, phase Wright into the background completely. I don\u2019t care how they do it. Make the man drink too much grape juice and fall off of Dusky Bridge or something again. I don\u2019t freaking know. But make something happen to the man so that Athena has to take up the reins on all of his cases, and assert herself more in the courtroom independently.\n\nEvery case she\u2019s in she\u2019s always relying on someone, be it Wright, Apollo, or Simon. Hell, even Klavier helps her out, which is kinda a good role for him, but it feels cheap that Athena never seems to have her own thoughts in a courtroom setting, and that one of the guys has to tell her.\n\nI mean, Mia was able to work well in T&T, so I don\u2019t get why Capcom\u2019s \u201cplaying it safe\u201d with Athena\u2019s character. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re terrified of the possibility of going too big and upsetting the apple cart, but that fear in and of itself is irrational.\n\nJust write the good stuff, and people will come, and if they don\u2019t (like in AJ), that\u2019s most likely the fault of Capcom trying to shoehorn in the cash cow Phoenix in a way people didn\u2019t want to receive him.\n\nWhat I think Capcom should have done with AJ is not highlight Phoenix Wright in the trailers whatsoever. Make everyone think he\u2019s done and gone, and then make a surprise reveal.\n\nThis way people can get a justifiable blindside if Capcom had only made it clear that Phoenix\u2019s story was over, then threw AJ out there as it\u2019s own independent game.\n\nBut those are just my two cents.", "Definitely. Everyone can admit Phoenix was a good character. He started the games and was the main character for three of them(hell technically almost all of them at this point) but, you\u2019re right if Capcom wants to go through the trouble of making two new defense attorneys they need to develop them in the present not with 100 different backstories to make the character more quirky and interesting *cough* Apollo *cough*\n\nThey got two really interesting characters and a bunch of prosecutors that people mostly love they don\u2019t need to keep falling back on the old formula.\n\nAthena and Klavier would be great he\u2019s not to harsh like all the other but, he also isn\u2019t dumb and would be a good challenge to build up Athena\u2019s skills in the courtroom seeing as she hasn\u2019t completed a whole trial by herself.\n\nAlso they need to somehow give her Wright Magatama for those black psyche locks I love them and as you said would complicate her \u201cpower\u201d nicely.\n\nAnyways I would love to hear any of your future fan theories I love geeking out about Ace attorney :)", "Well, I have another fan theory that I put some effort into thinking about, although it's probably more controversial in tone considering the person in question.\n\nThat person would be [Joe Darke](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12z069t/the_redemption_of_joe_darke_a_critical_analysis/), and how there could be an argument that despite the horrors that the man committed, there is a vague chance that he could have had guilt over the acts that he committed.\n\nOther theories I like to have that I haven't posted on deal primarily with Iris, and they're posted on other threads indicating that since Iris is no longer around, she might have simply decided to see someone else outside from Nick, and that's why Nick doesn't go to see her.\n\nEdit: Screw it. I took out the content in this content, and made a new post to cover [Redd White](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/13049et/ace_attorney_the_possibility_of_grossberg/) because it was a massive stream of consciousness.", "You know I was reading through this and it kinda all adds up in a weird way.\n\nIt\u2019s been a hot minute since I played all of the games so I won\u2019t claim to be an expert but, I think it definitely would have been an interesting case to accuse Grossberg instead of Redd White.\n\nI mean Redd White on his own was just a cartoonish villain for one thing and from the onset the player is aware that he is the one that killed Mia making the whole sequence of events less impactful.\n\n Had it been revealed that it was in fact Grossberg pulling the strings behind the scenes the trial definitely would have been a lot more than what it was.\n\nIn regard to Grossberg character you\u2019re right on point about his lackluster excuses I mean on its own he seems like such a filler character- forgettable at best. That would make it more of a shock if it was suddenly revealed that oh he\u2019s actually this mastermind who betrayed Mia. \n\nIf he had a sprite similar to Kristoph once he breaks down it would be perfect. \n\nAs for the theory as a whole it makes sense that he would kill Mia out of fear when she wouldn\u2019t surrender the files but, the only doubt I have is in regards to the events leading up to her murder. The question is would it have been in Redd Whites best interest to kill Mia.\n\nOkay so hear me out he goes into the office to steal the files and protect himself from Grossbergs blackmail and Mia finds him there (that\u2019s what happened right?) and he kills her?\n\n In the moment maybe I could believe it but, once Grossberg finds out she\u2019s dead he would be free to release the blackmail material since he would assume that it was him who killed her because she was collecting dirt on him. \n\nThat being said I feel like it would be more logical to explain the situation. seeing as Mia already knows he\u2019s a blackmailer. If he explained to her what Grossberg was doing maybe they could partner up to end his reign of terror. That being said Mia might not even believe him if this were to occur seeing as he was already backed into a corner.\n\nReally the only way Redd White was getting out of anything was by stealing those files Mia had. Anything else would result in him being killed or exposed so it\u2019s hard to say what else he could have done.\n\nAll and all it\u2019s a great theory the idea is very well thought out and makes a lot of sense. There were a lot of missed opportunities in the game to make the cases more interesting/complex.\n\nGoing completely off topic for a second back to what I said earlier about Ace attorney investigations I think it would be a good idea if Capcom had released more of them (for example one with Klavier or Blackquill) I feel like that would have allowed them to flesh out the characters a bit more like they did with Edgworth. (For example I feel like Klavier is a very complex character in his relationship with Kristoph and his band but, they barley touch on his personality at all before the game ends which in my opinion is a missed opportunity)", "Yeah. Totally agree with your thoughts on Klavier, especially considering how he's no longer in the Gavineers. It would be interesting to see his own friend groups and connections. Maybe put a highlight out there where Klavier goes to see Daryan Crescend even though the man murdered an Interpol agent. One could make a fanfiction off of that where he goes to see Kristoph while he's already at the penitentiary to see his old friend, Daryan.\n\nAs for why Redd killed Mia rather than teaming up with her? I would argue here that it was primarily...an action of panic on Redd's part. After all, Redd didn't know the full extent of Mia's connections to Grossberg, and Redd isn't exactly the kinda guy that won't get incredibly paranoid at his information network bubble being prodded out.\n\nIn other words, I think Redd would have still chosen to kill in this instance because he saw Mia as a threat to him and his network. However, there is also another dilemma I'd like to address, and it has to do with April May.\n\nFor instance, why would April May be involved with Redd's excursion to hunt down Mia? Why didn't Redd simply get his hands dirty by himself? After all, if things came down to a plea bargain situation, April could turn in Redd for his murder. After all, she most likely knew what Redd did in the first place, and she was also guilty of wiretapping, which I believe is a federal crime in the AA universe?\n\nBut...let's dial things back a bit to the reason Mia even got a statue. Larry gave her that statue, right? And it was a one-of-a-kind statue? Also, let's consider the fact that Larry had a connection to Cindy Stone, a model who had numerous \"sugar daddies\".\n\nThis is going to sound out-of-left field, but what if Redd White hired Frank Sahwit to steal from Cindy's house to look for dirt on somebody like Marvin? What if Redd suspected Grossberg as being someone who had connections to Cindy?\n\nNow, going back to the act of striking Mia dead with the Thinker, I think it's interesting how we're shown both Redd White and Frank Sahwit as killers who strike with the Thinker in sequential cases. I don't believe this was ever done in a later game, though correct me if I'm wrong. But what if there's more to these two men's cases than what we see on the surface?\n\nIn other words, we have a mysterious \"sugar daddy\" X that Redd White is looking into per his information network, and this individual has a connection to Cindy. If this \"sugar daddy\" X were actually Marvin Grossberg, then it highlights how Redd was looking into Marvin for quite a while.\n\nNow, let's dial back to April May for a second here. She's Redd's secretary, flaunts herself around older men in an attempt to get what she wants? Sounds kinda like Cindy? Absolutely. Now, is it possible that April has a sugar daddy in Grossberg, and Grossberg brought her with Redd to keep tabs on Redd? I would argue that this is definitely the case here.\n\nIn other words, I'm going to argue here that Grossberg was already watching Redd from the start through the eyes of April May. That's why Redd couldn't team up with Mia. It was kill or be killed for Redd, and he knew it.\n\nDo you have any thoughts regarding that amendment to my theory?\n\nEdit: In addition to this, Grossberg could've brought April along because he knew about Frank's connection to Redd, and that Redd was snooping. In other words, Redd and Grossberg both knew that Grossberg had him on a tight leash, so Redd couldn't get away with anymore shenanigans against Grossberg. For Redd, it was either steal the files from Mia, or have his life upended by Grossberg. In other words, Grossberg was the true blackmailer of Redd White all along.", "That adds a whole new level that I\u2019m here for.\n\nA lot of what you explained seemed like just frivolous details at the time but, when it\u2019s out all together you\u2019re right a lot of things don\u2019t add up.\n\nI mean in the Ace attorney universe there is no such thing as a coincidence. You\u2019re right that Redd White was probably panicking. Everywhere he turned he either got revealed as a blackmailer or he got killed as you stated by his clients for revealing their secrets. \n\nNow regarding Cindy I think giving her that depth as a character actually gives Frank (Not even attempting to spell his last name) a more valid reason to kill her. He is the kind of guy who has a temper but, tries to hide it. Seeing as that is his defining characteristic he probably became worried after being caught that he would expose himself as going against Grossberg. Knowing what he could do ,killing Cindy seemed like the safer option. \n\nIf only he hadn\u2019t cemented himself on the witness stand. I think that is arrogance on his part or maybe more-? If he could charm his way out of being at the scene then no one would suspect a thing. And if he did get caught he could make sure the case never went past the surface level - let them believe he would kill Cindy simply for a couple bucks instead of his real reason that would get him killed and Redd White exposed. If he was exposed he would have the wrath of both of them aimed at him.\n\nSeeing as his accomplice was arrested Redd White probably had to take it upon himself to get things sorted out- not knowing that April May was reporting to Grossberg.\n\nCircling back to Cindy for a second I have another possible theory that spoils the same murder weapons theory but, I think it\u2019s plausible seeing as Grossberg is pretty evil already. So before covering what I think -I want to first draw attention to the closing scene in the second case. The one where Phoenix is talking to Larry who is bawling his eyes about Cindy not caring about him. In response to this Phoenix argues that the fact that she brought the statue he made for her on her trip meant that she cared.\n\nThis made me think- and this is just speculation- that perhaps Cindy was deciding to not see Grossberg anymore after meeting Larry. Maybe she was trying to detach herself from her \u201csugar daddies\u201d and focus on Larry. And maybe just maybe Grossberg found out and sent Frank to get dirt on her instead to force her to stay with him. When she discovered him breaking in Frank panicked and ended her life accidentally. Of course this throws my whole prior spiel about Franks motive under the bus but, this is just my theory (a game theory :))on the matter.\n\nAnyways going back to April May finally I could see her kind of being Grossbergs lackey in a sense. She is unimposing and eye candy in a sense that Grossberg probably knew Redd White wouldn\u2019t think twice about. The motive for her wiretapping the phone didn\u2019t really make much sense in the game which adds credibility to your theory that she was actually working under Grossberg. This means that she would be atune to taking calculated risks as she has experience with blackmail through Grossberg.\n\nGoing back to the trial yet again she plays off her personality very well and only confesses when it\u2019s dragged out of her but, was it? I mean she could have probably fought the charge but, she eventually let it stick. Maybe she figured that going to jail would save her from Grossbergs wrath after she failed to stop Mia\u2019s death.\n\nI mean Grossberg was just using Mia but, it was probably an insult to his pride that she was killed by Redd White. He probably didn\u2019t predict he would go so far.\n\nFinally trailing back to Klavier for a second (because why not) I like to think that the games could have included a DLC case that really touched on Klaviers character after his brothers arrest and exposure of wrong doings. I mean even in the finally case of Apollo Justice you can see that he is facing some sort of crisis after realizing that his brother is more sociopathic than he thought. \n\nThe DLC also could have touched on this and had some dialogue maybe between him and Apollo where Apollo noticed a nervous twitch of his and presses him on how he feels about his band dissolving and his brother going to jail. That would really strengthen his character and give him depth we only got hints of in the games. \n\n(Also because I\u2019m a shipper Klavier and Apollo I mean come on they literally have the most basis for a relationship to form out of all the characters- I mean Klaviers opening line(which I know is explainable but, it still exists), his flirtatious nature and compliments of Apollo in court and he even invites Apollo to dinner in 6-3. I would believe it if it was a one sided love affair but, Capcom is denying something that is clearly there) \n\nAnyways ,let me know your thoughts on my theory in the middle kinda went on a tangent there for a second but, the theory was really well thought out.", "Yeah, I suppose your theory is also plausible if Frank killed for the sake of Grossberg. Redd could have been investigating that in addition to keeping tabs on Mia while Grossberg was using April May as his new set of eyes and ears around Redd White.\n\nAfter all, let's assume for a moment that when Redd White took the painting, Grossberg chose not to put a bug on it because Redd White is likely a paranoid party who would meticulously check it for something like a bug.\n\nHowever, April May had access to Redd's office, and she's already known for planting bugs, so that's why she planted one in Redd's office. April then got context that Redd was looking into Mia and alerted Grossberg. Grossberg then prompted April to take Redd out to the Gatewater Hotel to keep an eye on things.\n\nAnd while we're at it, let's throw some more shade here. Why not add the bellboy to the mix? After all, where in the world do we even have proof that Redd White checked in with April May other than that lone bellboy's word? And could that word be bought?\n\nLet's recall the fact that the bellboy is adamant about Wright having him give an affidavit. Most people wouldn't be that obsessive, unless he wanted to be called up as a witness. In other words, Grossberg was leaving breadcrumbs for Phoenix to follow to get Redd White. I'd argue that Redd only claimed to be in the hotel with April because he knew Grossberg was up to something, and maybe...just maybe...Grossberg was the second man in the Gatewater Hotel room. All he had to do...was bribe the bellboy into saying it was Redd White, and that was that.\n\nAlso, consider how Maya was told by Mia that Grossberg would defend her for Mia's murder. Yet...surprise surprise, when Wright goes to Grossberg to ask him, the man refuses to help Maya. Why? Why did this supposedly noble man refuse to help Maya?\n\nCould it not be because Grossberg knew Redd White's guilt from the start, and the fact that Grossberg knew he had to remain in the shadows to get a leg-up on Redd White so that Redd wouldn't use his other secure connections to attack Grossberg?\n\nGrossberg knew from the start that if he put Maya to the coals, Phoenix would defend her, and then Maya would be stressed out enough to channel Mia, who would reveal the dirt on Redd White without a second thought. Grossberg calculated Mia's actions out completely. He understood exactly what she would do in that situation.\n\nAlso, do we even need to bring up Robert Hammond, Yanni Yogi, and DL-6? Boy, is that ever a rabbit hole if I ever saw one, especially considering how Hammond worked for Grossberg. Coincidence? That's what Marvin would like to have Phoenix believe, but as you said earlier, there are no coincidences in Ace Attorney. Hammond's dark law practices had to be learnt from someone, and who else could teach them but Marvin Grossberg himself?", "And it comes full circle. Honestly the originally ace attorney could have been Apollo Justice done right. All this potential set up in the background to reveal Grossberg behind it all similar to Kristoph (except he was revealed early)\n\nI love rise from the ashes but, it would have been amazing if the case instead connected everything together like that.\n\nNot gonna lie I was meticulously checking my inbox after posting my last comment lol you did not disappoint.\n\nNow adding the bell boy to the mix really turns this thing into conspiracy. It is definitely plausible that he was bought after all he had no stake in phoenixs case so therefore no reason not to be influenced by the promise of money. Besides it would make sense if he was in on it to as it seems like according to your theory that Grossberg was pulling the strings all along. Everything that happened in that trial he predicted.\n\nEach and every witness was carefully placed by him to lead Phoenix to Redd White. I think somewhere along the line Redd White picked up on that as he shows aversion to Phoenix and even attempts to harm him. \n\nNow you would think this would be normal but he\u2019s usually very composed which makes this action of attacking Phoenix come out of the blue unless you assume that he was already under intense stress.\n\nI mean he had just killed a women and was actively fighting for his right to remain living. If he had to attack the lawyer he viewed to be working for the enemy he would.\n\nTo be honest Grossberg could have been the biggest villain in ace attorney. As I stated for April May he\u2019s unimposing and doesn\u2019t really stick out character design wise.\n\nYou can brush him off as being feeble but, as seen with Yanni Yogi appearances can be deceiving. Mia died never knowing the true depths of blackmail Grossberg was involved in. Maybe that was what he really wanted all along.\n\nI mean to him she had served her purpose to make Redd White sweat a bit- maybe he viewed her as a liability and directed him towards murder. Maybe I\u2019m taking a shot in the dark here but, with everything else he\u2019s done it\u2019s hard to ignore the possibility. After all he knew Maya could channel and everything played out perfectly. Coincidence? I think not.\n\nRedd White was effectively neutralized with no one knowing anything they shouldn\u2019t. After all everyone who was involved was either ignorant of wrapped around Grossbergs finger through money or threats.\n\nI never thought as well that Grossberg could have been responsible for DL-6 that really illustrates the big role he could have had in everything that occurred in the first game.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he was keeping tabs on Maya and Phoenix seeing as Mia could have revealed something he didn\u2019t like. Then with DL-6 coming back to light he most likely lied low for the next couple games.\n\nMaybe in that time though he interacted with Phoenix in someway\u2026.\n\n Maybe he threatened Trucy or maybe Phoenix went willingly but, he could have manipulated him into thinking he liked forging evidence- slowly dragging him deeper into the criminal underground. I mean the bar Phoenix was at was known for illegal activity.\n\nThis of course ties back to the theory in your original post.\n\nAnyways tell me your thoughts :) (apologies for any spelling errors I missed)\n\nEdit: if you respond anymore tonight I\u2019ll get back to you in the morning gotta head out pretty soon", "And then this leaves us with an important question. In other words, the denouement. Apollo Justice has officially checked out as of SOJ, leaving only Athena, Trucy, and Wright remaining at the Wright Anything Agency.\n\nIf one were to assume that every game actually had a calculated purpose, and everything is connected, did Phoenix Wright realize the depths of Grossberg's evil, and did he become the man that he would have normally despised?\n\nDid he attack and convict an innocent man, Kristoph Gavin, for murder, and even get his own brother Klavier open to the idea that Kristoph, a potentially innocent man, is not needed anymore? Going off of that, is it any wonder why Kristoph snapped?\n\nAnd did Phoenix get Athena out of her trauma and catching the Phantom only because the Phantom and Ga'ran were both political threats to the Dark Age of the Law that Grossberg could have taught Wright about in detail?\n\nIn other words, are Athena Cykes...and Klavier Gavin...going to have a revelation of a case...where it comes out that our hero, Phoenix Wright, was actually turned into a monster by Marvin Grossberg, and how not even his friends are aware of the true depths to which Phoenix has actually fallen?\n\nAnd most importantly, does Marvin Grossberg get away with directly producing the Dark Age of the Law through Phoenix? And does Phoenix get away with being the Forgin' Attorney?\n\nLet's think about how Phoenix gathers evidence in his cases for a second, and how no police authority is around when he finds the \"key\" evidence for his cases. Isn't that a sign that he could be forging some evidence here and there without us even noticing?\n\nEven more important to consider...did Marvin cover-up Manfred's involvement in DL-6? Was the government actually aware of what happened to Miles Edgeworth as a child? After all, if the Redd White theory is correct, then the Minister of Justice is guilty...and so then the entire justice system is corrupt. And it would have been corrupt WAY before AJ.\n\nThis...essentially means that every character...every case...that Phoenix Wright has taken...could be thrown out if he were found out. Every case Apollo took. And...every case Athena took. The whole Wright Anything Agency would go under scrutiny.\n\nAlso, isn't it kinda weird how Thalassa is known by Phoenix to be Trucy and Apollo's mother, yet Phoenix never once tells them about her? That's...kinda scary when one thinks about Phoenix having these dark connections to Marvin.\n\nIt...even makes one wonder...is Iris even alive? Or...well...is she dead? Did she kill herself? Is that why Mia never comes back around? Was Godot right to cast such vitriol and hate against Wright for what happened to Mia? Was Godot seeing something nobody else was about Wright?\n\nI could make a whole other theory on Phoenix actually being in love with Dahlia over Iris, and given this Grossberg theory, it's probably going to be dark. Something to the effect of...Iris might commit suicide in prison or something.\n\nFirst of all, if I were to analyze Phoenix's character in Mia's second case, Grossberg is involved here, so we've gotta look into it. Phoenix recounts numerous times about how he loves Dahlia because of the necklace he gave her being a sign of their love. But...Iris didn't give Phoenix that necklace, as it was actually Dahlia.\n\nEven if Wright never once saw Dahlia, can we really ignore the possibility that Phoenix could actually be a Terry Fawles 2.0 in hiding? Do we even know who Phoenix Wright...even is?\n\nThink about the Phantom's reveal as Phoenix for a second. Isn't that...kinda symbolic and significant of something big that's about to go down regarding Phoenix's character regarding how some of the writers might understand him?\n\nIs Phoenix Wright...actually a man of madness?", "Eh...yeah...probably went a bit overboard there on some accounts. But I genuinely wonder where Iris fits into the whole mess of events. It makes me wonder whether or not she could've been the actual person to jump off of Dusky Bridge as per Dahlia's kidnapping plot.\n\nShe could've chickened out, but it does beg the question on why else Dahlia would've needed Iris to be involved with the plot if (to my understanding) Terry didn't know about Iris to begin with.\n\nOr maybe Terry actually did know about Iris or something? In the end, I guess that's only known by Iris herself at this point.", "Iris feels like such a one off character in her own right. Like she had prior connections to Phoenix and the game just promptly ditched her because her story was done. It doesn\u2019t add up which means it makes sense to assume that something happened to her or Phoenix never had any interest in her to begin with.\n\nYour theory about Dahlia makes a lot of sense as he goes down the same path as Terry falks except he escapes his fate through Mia. Maybe this experience caused him to see court through a negative lens. Maybe that case made him want to become a lawyer not because of what he saw but, in order to never be a victim like that again.\n\nWhat if he became a lawyer to to prove to Dahlia that he wasn\u2019t one to be triffled with. After all under all the butterfly\u2019s and pink is a person with a dark heart.\n\nWould Phoenix sacrifice everything to be with her? I mean sure she died but, she has come back through Maya before. Maybe there\u2019s a reason he keeps her around. (I\u2019m probably reaching a bit)\n\nMaybe he realized the evidence was forged in the original case and maybe he though that he could get away with it? After all Phoenix is shown to be strong willed. Would he have fallen for Grossbergs ploys so easily? Maybe he in truth wanted to learn more about the ways of Von karma as he never wants to loose again.\n\nIt is strange how he is able to prove almost any client innocent, going against Edgeworths perfect streak. It almost lines up to perfectly. Even the case where he looses can be explained by his desire to keep Maya alive as the only sole person that can bring Dahlia back to life. (Don\u2019t remember when she died but you get the idea. Once he found out she could channel that was it)\n\nAnyways going back to what you said about Apollo and Athena. It is important to note that the first case they did without Wrights influence was in SoJ and even then Trucy was involved. Maybe they didn\u2019t know that they were using forged evidence provided by Trucy at her daddy\u2019s orders. Or maybe they got lucky and both of their clients were innocent. I\u2019m probably going a bit to deep down the rabbit hole.\n\nAlong with this though an Athena and Klavier duo would be the perfect duo to uncover this plot. I mean Athena has personal experience with Wright and wants to step into her own as a lawyer and Klavier knows deep down that his brother is innocent (he wants to anyways) so they would both have motive to uncover the plot.\n\nHopefully that\u2019s clear enough I had a lot I wanted to say but, didn\u2019t know how to word it smoothly.", "Here's another idea I thought about with Iris. It may or may not make sense in context of how certain things happened, but I'm going to go with it, regardless.\n\nFor some expansion on my thoughts regarding this, I suppose that Iris and Dahlia themselves need to be addressed separately in this case. I'm going to focus on Mia's second case where Grossberg got involved.Now, we know that Phoenix was with Iris for a long time, but what's strange about this whole thing is the fact that Dahlia disappeared after dating Doug Swallow, the man Wright was accused of killing, eight or more months before his death.So, if we're to go off the notion that Dahlia actually killed Doug and Iris had no part in the murder plot of Doug Swallow whatsoever, then she could not have been on campus whatsoever.\n\nIris was also dumped off to Sister Bikini by Dahlia's father per Dahlia's suggestion at a young age, and Dahlia asked Iris to be part of a plot. However, we're told that Iris got cold feet here, and then later on when it came to Phoenix Wright, Dahlia asked Iris to get the necklace from Wright.The part that's weird though is how Doug fits into this whole mess, as he knew Dahlia likely stole from him for eight months, but said nothing? That sounds pretty sketchy when you think about it, and considering the fact that Iris was dating Wright at this time, one can reasonably conclude that something or someone must have prevented Doug from talking for eight months.\n\nNow, the weird part of this is that Iris somehow was on campus at the same time as Dahlia, yet Iris never reacted or blew her cover despite not being told about things by Dahlia.In other words, it's a little hard to believe that Phoenix couldn't have known where his Dollie was on campus, as before all this, Phoenix and Iris were inseparable. Also, if Iris was unawares about Dahlia's murder plot toward Phoenix in the first place like Dahlia said, then that means that Phoenix could have run into Dollie after confronting Doug.\n\nBut...now here's the million dollar question. Dahlia stole poison to put in Wright's cold medicine, but she still needed to make sure that she got a hold of Wright's cold medicine somehow. In other words, Dahlia had to physically meet up with Wright again to give him his cold medicine. Instead, Dahlia chose to put it on Doug's corpse because she was worried about witnesses appearing on the scene.But why in the world would Dahlia have been so concerned about being spotted with Coldkiller X medicine, even if it had poison in it? If things got too hairy, she could have always handed it off to Iris since Iris wasn't part of the plot and both girls were on campus. But then we have a problem with things now, as there's no clear reason about why Doug had the Coldkiller X planted on his body by Dahlia.\n\nSo...here's an idea. What if Doug snatched the Coldkiller X from Phoenix instead after his altercation with Wright? Let's also assume that Dahlia already met up with Phoenix and gave him the poisoned bottle, and she was none the wiser about Doug doing this after the fact. Also, let's remember that Iris is not familiar with the plot since Dahlia never told her about what transpired.\n\nWe also know that Doug knows that poison was stolen at this time. In other words, what's the man to do but confront Dahlia face-to-face? But...and this is an important but...did Doug pick the right Dahlia to confront? Or did he mistakenly pick Iris?\n\nImagine if you were Iris, and you were told something to the equivalent of the fact that your sister stole poison from her ex-boyfriend to kill your current boyfriend. Oh, and also, Doug thinks you are her now because of mistaken identity, and you can't tell him without blowing your cover. What would Iris have done if push came to shove? Could Iris have killed Doug? And could Iris have killed Valerie because her cover was also going to be blown by her stepsister Valerie? Is this also why Dahlia considers Iris to be a, in her own words, a \"backstabber\" and a \"traitor\"? Maybe Dahlia actually loved Doug more than Phoenix or Terry in the end. Both have similar personalities to some extent, so it's plausible.\n\nIn other words, maybe Dahlia actually discovered Doug after Iris had killed her, and genuinely cried over his body out of remorse without killing him. But remember that Grossberg was present in this trial, and since Dahlia had been the one to hypothetically poison Diego Armando, Grossberg wanted to take down a Hawthorne no matter what, and so did Mia. But here's another question. Did Mia take down the right Dahlia that murdered her stepsister Valerie? Or was it actually Iris who did the deed? Is Dahlia innocent of all charges against her, and Iris was the one actually doing the actions? How do we know that Dahlia wasn't the one who went into a cloistered life? After all, all we have is her word and Iris's, and Dahlia was already dead anyway. Why would Dahlia even bother telling people in court the truth about herself and who she actually was. Hell, the dead Dahlia could even be Iris.\n\nNow, I know there's a rebuttal against Dahlia being Iris since it's stated that in order for a spirit to be channeled, one needs their true name and face. But there's nothing saying that Dahlia and Iris couldn't have name-swapped or pulled a parent-trap on Morgan their father. Honestly, the two of them probably wouldn't even have noticed a difference, and neither would Valerie, their stepsister. This allows for Dahlia Hawthorne to actually be the same as the Iris Hawthorne who lived a cloistered life at the Hazakura Temple for all her days. However, there is an important divergence here since Iris has to get involved at Ivy League University following Godot's poisoning.\n\nIn other words, the girl that cried over Doug Swallow's body is the Dahlia that died, and there's no debate on this front, or...so we think. After all, we already know Grossberg's involvement in this case is intriguing given our past theories. Grossberg likely had blackmail material on the judge and police wardens, and if Grossberg wanted to, he could make Dahlia into another agent similar to that of April May or the bellboy. Grossberg was also familiar with the Fey family, and was likely aware of the location of \"Iris Hawthorne\", as well as the fact that the girl that was arrested, \"Dahlia Hawthorne\", was actually Iris Hawthorne.\n\nSo, Grossberg pulled another parent trap, but this time with deadly consequences for innocent Dahlia Hawthorne. Dahlia in the Hazakura Temple got swapped out for Iris, and Dahlia died. Then, Iris, the real killer of Valerie Hawthorne and Doug Swallow, takes her sister's place at Hazakura Temple.\n\nLet's also recall how Terry Fawles called Dahlia his \"teen angel\", similar to how Wright considers Dahlia to be his \"Dollie\". Both men express similarities in the way they see Dahlia, but we know that Wright was actually with Iris. But couldn't the same have applied to Terry? Actually, when one thinks about it further, things start to line up.\n\nDahlia upon being interrogated by Wright in Bridge to the Turnabout says that everything she did was for her own self-interest. In other words, Dahlia would rather have her sister Iris jump off the bridge rather than herself. In other words, Iris must have been involved with Dahlia's plot despite Iris saying she chickened out at the last moment if we're to believe Dahlia is as selfish as she depicts herself. So...who is telling the truth here? Dahlia or Iris? Because it cannot possibly be both.\n\nThis is why I'm inclined to believe that Dahlia is lying about doing everything for her own self-interest. Dahlia does believe her sister to be a traitor and a backstabber, but she might have had justification if Grossberg caused Iris to transfer herself out and essentially take her life as her own. Dahlia wanted revenge against Mia Fey, the attorney who in her own mind, ripped her away from her cloistered life and sentenced her to death.\n\nIn other words, with the mistaken identity thrown into the mix, and a possibility for a miscommunication like this to happen, it's entirely plausible Iris could have killed Doug Swallow and Valerie Hawthorne. Then, after Bridge to the Turnabout, Iris fades into the background, likely after Grossberg helped her get off the hook for her crimes, and she retreated to some deserted island someplace.\n\nThis theory's got less evidence to it than all my rest, but I made tangential connections to Grossberg as a result, and I think this is all possible. I can probably come up with more legitimate reasons behind this (such as the blue flames around the Magatama being emblematic and symbolic of wisdom, a characteristic of the Iris flower, which is strange for Dahlia's character to have unless she was Iris Hawthorne).", "So..I read all this and you know it makes sense. Sure it is lacking in evidence in the games but, that\u2019s the beauty with them, there are ways around the logic used in them. Not to mention that the original cases you are talking about are shrouded in mystery. I mean we only get information from a case file provided by Grossberg and testimony from two people.\n\nOne who is being accused of murder and one who will tell any number of lies in order to protect Dahlia/Iris.\n\nThe case seems rigged from the start.\n\nAnyways I think this theory has some merit although it gets confusing with how often the twins would have to switch places in order to pull it off. Along with this we would have to assume that Iris\u2019 personality is actually Dahlias and vice versa. One more flaw I think is a simple one but, what about the difference in hair color. I mean they both have noticeably different features and maybe I could believe that there were some hair dying shenanigans but, you would think Doug would realize who he was talking to.\n\nI\u2019m not sure but, other than that it is plausible. Sorry I don\u2019t have more to say my brain isn\u2019t functioning well today and the paragraphs became muddled in my brain. Still everything you wrote makes sense for the most part and would have added a whole knew depth level to the case.", "Yeah, in a sense, one would have to assume that Iris was actually the cold and calculated one and not Dahlia in a sense.\n\nWhat I'd argue here is one of two possibilities. The first one being that the two never switched places at all until Phoenix's trial, and after \"Dahlia\" (in this case, the one Mia suspects for the crimes is actually Iris Hawthorne) was incarcerated. But then if one assumes a shadow network backed by government corruption, one could have pulled Iris out in the hopes that she could have been a spirit medium they could have exploited for their own nefarious ends (please see [this theory of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131dftt/ace_attorney_the_redd_white_and_grossberg/) for more context on how a Fey daughter like Iris could have been hypothetically sought after by the shadow network, even if she couldn't actually channel because it'd open their way to connections in different places such as the Hazakura Temple by having her take Dahlia's former place if one assumes Dahlia was actually the girl raised by Bikini).\n\nAs for their hair color, yeah...I'd argue hair dye had to be used, so it's most likely inconsequential, and Phoenix was oblivious to Iris/Dahlia anyway, so their appearances could have been similar enough to fool even Doug. \n\nThe other possibility I'd like to suggest is that \"Dahlia\" (or the one we think of as Iris in the games) could have even been the one to date all the men in the first place, and \"Iris\" (or the one we think of as the dead Dahlia in the games) never actually dated them, met them whatsoever, or even attempted to kill them or go along with any plots of \"Dahlia\". In that sense, there would be no contradictions if \"Dahlia\" just committed the crimes against Valerie, Terry, Diego, Doug, and Phoenix all by herself. In other words, there's a possibility that \"Iris\" didn't even need to leave to go to Ivy League University since \"Dahlia\" was actually lying about \"Iris\" assisting her with the men. So there's be no need for confusion amongst the twins in this instance, which is actually more plausible than even the canon theory regarding the two.\n\nAlso, I can present some evidence to refute something about Dahlia being an evil spirit. When she was channeled by Misty Fey in the games, Dahlia puts on a hood similar to one that Iris wore. Now, if one considers the court record on [Iris's hood](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Iris's_Hood), we can see a startling tidbit of information in the description of the hood: **A magical hood said to offer protection from evil spirits.** Now...assuming the magical hood was to do its job...wouldn't Misty Fey...I dunno...not die? Wouldn't Dahlia basically exorcise herself in the process by doing this if she were truly evil?\n\nAlso, if Dahlia's not evil, then why did she try to kill Maya? Well, that's only because we're assuming Dahlia tried to kill Maya. After all, Dahlia never actually stabbed her because Diego had done her in before that. Sure, Diego says that Dahlia held her at knife-point and was about to stab her, but let's remember that Diego had a bone to pick with the girl who called herself \"Dahlia Hawthorne\". The dude didn't even stop to question whether or not the girl calling herself that wasn't actually lying to fool everyone about her real identity. He simply resorted to kill first, and ask questions later mentality.\n\nMaybe Dahlia simply wanted to let Maya know the truth about what happened to her, and have Maya pass on her story. But Godot never gave her the chance because of his own failings and grudge against a person he conceived to be a threat. Godot had no qualms about killing his accomplice, Misty Fey, though, and also Godot had connections to Marvin Grossberg as well. In other words, maybe not even Godot himself is immune to the depravities of darkness written by Grossberg.\n\nThe shadow network is unfeeling, after all. It doesn't give a damn about exploiting the souls of the dead, and torturing them to feed a sadistic agenda around giving people power.\n\nAlso, given how Dahlia's soul got exorcised from Maya, and the blue flames around her, those revealed the true essence of her soul was not one of strength and power, like Iris told us. Those symbols are characteristic of red flames (which appear around Dahlia when her butterflies get burnt during testimony).\n\nNo, these flames were blue, and they were in the shape of a spiritual nine. That could be considered emblematic of a Fey clan soul that was filled with wisdom. But wisdom is considered emblematic of an iris flower, or someone who lived a life filled with wisdom. That could track if Dahlia was actually the one raised by Bikini in Hazakura.\n\nIn other words, Dahlia Hawthorne could have been born that way alongside her sister Iris Hawthorne. But let's consider Mimi Miney and Turner Gray for a second here, and the malpractice charges Turner wanted to bring Mimi under in Case 2 of Ace Attorney, Game 2.\n\nLet's consider the fact that malpractice and quack doctors exist in the Ace Attorney universe. And let's also argue that with the pervasive elements of the shadow network, that these same quack doctors assign the true names to the babies, and not the parents themselves.\n\nIn other words, the shadow network could have taken the soul of a girl akin to that of an iris flower, and ascribed a name of \"Dahlia\" over her as her true name. In other words, people who channeled Dahlia Hawthorne with an image of the face of the \"Dahlia\" Hawthorne from the cases and crimes she committed in mind would still be able to summon her, and they would be none the wiser as to this true girl's crimes, which were ultimately none.\n\nThis soul akin to that of an iris doesn't show up until Dahlia is removed from Maya's body, however. Arguably, the only reason for why we actually see this is because Wright has his Magatama on him in the first place. This is why we never get another perspective like this ever again.\n\nIt could also explain Iris's mysterious disappearance from Phoenix's life, as she has now become one with the shadow network. And honestly, Phoenix probably found out about it, and that's why he turned to being the Forgin' Attorney.\n\nEdit: Also, for another tidbit of information, Dahlia says that she died via hanging. Another person who died via hanging is Celeste Inpax, whom many might believe simply died of a suicide. But where's the note? After all, Corrida forged it. Could these hangings be the shadow network's form of killing those it deems threats to its agenda? Were Celeste and Dahlia both threats?", "Also, assuming Dahlia's hatred for her mother Morgan Fey, it's plausible that Morgan (since she was Dahlia's cellmate) psychologically abused her in prison. Morgan could have even been aware of the fact that this was not the same girl who committed those heinous crimes she was accused of, and that it was actually her identical twin sister, Iris. But Morgan wouldn't mind Iris's existence because Morgan could mold innocent Dahlia into seeing herself as the monstrous \"Dahlia\" Hawthorne that Iris pulled over everyone's eyes. In other words, Morgan tarnished Dahlia's innocent soul, all for her own self-interest in exploiting her to try killing Maya later on.\n\nIn other words, Dahlia's soul was never truly evil because she had never committed a murder before up until that point, but people in her life made her believe she was capable of doing that. Ultimately, Dahlia never got the chance to prove anybody wrong, though, which could have been the greatest tragedy of them all.\n\nAlso, [here's Dahlia's final breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNd0WE518-I). Thought it'd be interesting to look at it from the other side of the spectrum. Namely, Dahlia's, assuming she's innocent.\n\nEdit: [Posted a theory on Dahlia now!](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131g0ul/ace_attorney_the_true_essence_of_dahlia/)"], "URLs": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131dftt/ace_attorney_the_redd_white_and_grossberg/)"], "html_title": ["r FanTheories comments ace attorney the redd white and grossberg"]},{"title": "[The Outer Limits] Episode \"The New Breed\"", "selftext": "This episode is in season 1 episode 14 of the revival series in the 90s\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy speculation is that since most stories in this series are not directly connected and live in their own universes, the world in this episode is doomed.

I've been delving deep into the SL-9 Incident, and I have an intriguing theory to share with you all about Joe Darke. Could he actually be a redemptive figure? Let's take a closer look at the evidence.\n\nFirstly, despite being a serial killer who took Ema hostage, Darke's behavior towards her after she pushed Neil Marshall is noteworthy. Ema passed out, but Darke remained conscious and was seen looking into Neil's eyes (as depicted in Ema's drawing) before Neil was shoved. This suggests that Darke may have had a moral code that prevented him from harming Ema, indicating a potential desire for redemption.\n\nSecondly, Darke's unusual behavior towards 13-year-old Ema could be connected to his past victims, particularly Rachael Moss and Jeb Bates. Darke's previous victims were killed in a psychotic rampage after hitting Edward Jones with his car, but Jeb's death was more delayed. Additionally, when one realizes Darke went to such lengths to bury the four bodies away from the site of the car accident, it makes one question whether he only did this to hide the evidence. This implies that Darke may have felt remorse and pity towards Rachael, showing a glimmer of humanity in his dark deeds.\n\nFurthermore, the crime of passion surrounding Jeb's death hints at Darke's inner conflict and struggles with his violent tendencies. It's possible that he was remorseful towards his victims, and his actions may have been driven by internal conflicts and a desire for redemption.\n\nLastly, Darke's behavior during his questioning at the police department raises questions. He managed to get ahead of the evidence, which could have been forged by Damon Gant, suggesting that Darke may have had genuine conflicts of character and was trying to come to terms with his actions.\n\nIn conclusion, Joe Darke may be a complex character with a potential for redemption in the SL-9 Incident. Despite his history of violence, there are indications of empathy, remorse, and conflicts of character that hint at a possible redemption arc for him. What are your thoughts on this theory?

Joe Darke did spree killings, and the game calls him a spree killer. However, in the case of Joe going from Rachael Moss to Jeb Bates, there had to have been a decent cooling off period because Jeb was a jogger who came across Joe as he was burying the bodies.\n\nSo, technically, I\u2019d argue that Joe is both a spree and a serial killer if one considers this in the context surrounding Jeb Bates\u2019s murder, and the fact that Joe had to bring the bodies away from the accident site (where he crashed his car into Edward) to where Jeb spotted him burying them.\n\nAlso, even if one could argue accidental killing for Edward and insanity charges for him killing Edith Kirby and Rachael Moss, Joe still killed Jason Knight because he wanted to call the police. So Jeb and Jason were two victims where Joe had some delay to think about things and his current situation. Joe may have even spoken to these two men before he killed them.\n\nRegardless, though, I felt that Joe got a bad rap as a total monster despite the fact that overworked people like Mimi Miney supposedly killed people by accident through medical malpractice and overworked conditions.\n\nThis mirrors essentially the same things as Joe Darke.

And why did she wait so long to kill judy.\n\nMy theory is that judy were both angela\u2019s sexual awakening, and what angela wanted look like herself. And those conflicting desires were what fueled her anger and acts of revenge.\n\nFirst of, judy as a sexual awakening. Judy is sexualized a lot in the movie, and angela in particular stares at her a lot. Angela\u2019s staring was what initially started the rivalry between the two. I think judy acted as Angela\u2019s first real interaction with a girl she was attracted to.\n\nBut because of the abuse from her aunt and the knowledge that (at the time) angela couldn\u2019t be with another girl and couldn\u2019t show judy her actual manly body, Angela pushed these feelings down and bottled them.\n\nSecondly, throughout the movie I couldn\u2019t help but notice that judy looked a lot angela, just a more mature version.\n\nI think that again because the abuse from her aunt and how ricky and paul sexualized her at the start, angela started to idealize Judy and desperately wanted to look like her.

She started by killing the pedo, an obvious villain she didn\u2019t have to feel bad about killing.

Among the items missing are clonazepam (for seizures) and Lexapro (which treats depression and anxiety)\n\nThe events of the film take place, and everything seems to work out for Ruth. She finds a footprint, the criminals didn\u2019t wipe her laptop, she finds the silverware, happens to see the van, the thief presents himself at her house, and she is (almost) unscathed during robbery at the end.\n\nTony gets stabbed and during the getaway Ruth has to dump the body. When she comes back to find him, she realises that she\u2019s lost him.\n\nEarlier in the film, Ruth sees the silverware and a flashback plays of her Grandmother, which shows Ruth as a child. When Ruth is looking for Tony, her Grandmothers ghost appears in the real world and points him out. I believe that this was actually a hallucination - it shows her exactly as she was in the memory\n\nA few things then happen in the end:\n\n\u2022 To Ruth\u2019s luck, Meredith is grateful that Ruth rescued her, and doesn\u2019t identify her in the robbery.

In the ending montage, she is sitting in traffic watching the same truck but the shot is flipped.

We\u2019re almost done here. Just one more part below\u2026\n\nRough Timeline of Events:\n\n* Old West timeline, Hill Valley, California (1895) - Doc Brown finishes building the Jules Verne Train using parts from Marty Mcfly\u2019s hoverboard, pieces of the DeLorean hidden in the mine, and 2015 technology. Once completed, he and his family use it to travel to the year 1985 in the Lone Pine Mall timeline.\n\n* Lone Pine Mall timeline, Hill Valley, California (1985) - Doc and his family visit Marty and his girlfriend Jennifer (ending of Back to the Future III).\n\n* Old West timeline, Hill Valley, California (1918-1920) - Jules Brown grows up, travels around the US, and eventually settles down in southern Michigan. While there, he marries a red-haired woman and gives birth to Smokey and Steamer.\n\n* North Pole Realm (1938)- During one of their adventures throughout the space time continuum, Doc and Clara discover a realm inhabited by Santa Claus and his elves. Doc Brown agrees to help Santa keep the spirit of Christmas alive by taking children to see him every year.\n\n* Old West timeline, southern Michigan/North Pole Realm (1938) - Doc uses futuristic technology to expand toy production in Santa\u2019s workshop and installs Santa\u2019s sleigh with a flux capacitor. Back in Michigan in the Old West timeline, Jules buys a used Baldwin 2-8-4 steam locomotive and helps his father convert it into a time machine. Doc becomes the train\u2019s conductor while Jules\u2019s kids, Smokey and Steamer, become the engineers. A railroad leading down Glacier Gulch is also constructed to allow the Polar Express to reach 888 miles per hour, a speed much higher than 88 to compensate for the train\u2019s immense weight and mass.\n\n* Old West timeline, Grand Rapids, Michigan (1939) - The Polar Express begins picking up kids from around the world in the Old West and Lone Pine Mall timelines. One year, the train picks up some kids in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and King rides without a ticket.\n\n* Old West timeline, Uncharted Polar Region (1939) - King is swept off the train and killed after it passes through Flattop Tunnel.\n\n* Lone Pine Mall timeline, Grand Rapids, Michigan (1977) - Chris wishes to visit Santa Claus, and is transported to the North Pole with through Santa\u2019s use of magic.\n\n* North Pole Realm (1977) - Chris arrives at the North Pole and meets the Brown family and Santa Claus. He becomes the Conductor of the Polar Express after Doc steps down.\n\n* Lone Pine Mall timeline, Uncharted Polar Region (1978) - The Conductor is saved from nearly falling off the train by King before it passes through Flattop Tunnel.\n\n* Lone Pine Mall timeline, Grand Rapids, Michigan (1957) - The Conductor travels back to his childhood home in 1957 to pick up his younger self.\n\n* Lone Pine Mall timeline, Glacier Gulch (1957) - The Polar Express drives down Glacier Gulch and \u201cjumps\u201d forward to the North Pole.\n\n* North Pole Realm (1957) - The Polar Express arrives at the North Pole, and the younger Chris meets Santa Claus.\n\n* Lone Pine Mall timeline, Grand Rapids, Michigan (1957) - Chris returns home to his neighborhood five minutes after midnight.\n\nRandom Additional Points:\n\n*(As for why the Polar Express is shown stopping on tracks when Chris pulls the emergency brake, that\u2019s just how he remembers the train stopping. In reality, the train was hovering above the ground, but it coming to a screeching halt on railroad tracks is the only thing that would make sense to a young child. The emergency brake simply stopped the train while it was hovering)*\n\n*(After years of time traveling, Doc Brown was able to build flux capacitors that not only allowed time and universal travel, but time manipulation. This explains why Chris\u2019s clock was frozen, why it was always five minutes before midnight, and why time resumed once Chris was given the first gift of Christmas: the Polar Express simply froze time to travel to the North Pole)*\n\n*(After it \u201cjumps\u201d to the North Pole, the Polar Express normally drives on tracks across the lake. But during the trip shown in the film, the ice just happened to freeze over the tracks)*\n\n*(At the end of Back to the Future III when Marty returns to 1985, he takes Jennifer to see the wrecked DeLorean. As they are standing near the railroad, the railroad crossing lights activate without a train approaching them. Just then, the Jules Verne Train shows up on the tracks. It is as if the lights were picking up some sort of interference from the train, even though it hadn\u2019t yet made it to 1985. This is interesting as something similar happens at the beginning of The Polar Express. As the train approaches Chris\u2019s house, his bedroom begins to shake and the heater beside his window shoots out steam.

Despite having magical abilities and a workshop full of elves, he foresaw that he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with Earth\u2019s increasing population. I also imagine that as Earth\u2019s population kept growing, the Christmas spirit started to decrease with each generation. Less and less children believed in the Big Man. This resulted in Santa\u2019s magical powers weakening. Needing a way to preserve the Christmas spirit and to deliver presents faster in the future, Santa hired Doc Brown to transform his workshop into a full-fledged toy factory. This explains all of the futuristic gadgets that are present throughout the North Pole. \n\nOne piece of machinery that adds credence to this part of the theory is the weird suction pod that transports Chris and his friends to the observatory. Another is the giant globe keeping track of kids around the world. Perhaps these devices are products of Doc Brown\u2019s brilliant mind. I\u2019m sure he also had enough futuristic technology from all the time traveling he did after Back to the Future III.\n\nTo help Saint Nick deliver presents to more children at a convenient pace, Doc installed a flux capacitor in Santa\u2019s sleigh. This allows Santa to stop time and deliver presents much quicker than he would have been able to do hundreds of years before meeting the Brown family. Including a flux capacitor in the sleigh also explains why it disappears while leaving a trail of sparks behind. It was doing the same thing the DeLorean did throughout the Back to the Future trilogy: flew up to 88 miles per hour and traveled to the Lone Pine Mall timeline.\n\nNow all Santa needed was a way to preserve the spirit of Christmas among an ever-increasingly doubtful population. So he had Doc Brown build him a time train out of an old Michigan Baldwin to pick up kids living in the Old West and Lone Pine Mall timelines.\n\n*(NOTE: Santa\u2019s sleigh having a flux capacitor was first theorized by user u/Hyrule_Hystorian)*\n\nPART 6:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xo982/part_6_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1", "id": "12xo3gp", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xo3gp/part_5_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/", "created_utc": 1682353418.0, "score": 0, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/12xo3gp/part_5_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/", "comments": [], "URLs": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xo054/part_4_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1", "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/polarexpress/images/6/65/SantaClaus.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130103024649", "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xo982/part_6_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1"], "html_title": ["r FanTheories comments part my longest and most indepth polar", "polarexpress images SantaClaus jpg revision latest", "r FanTheories comments part my longest and most indepth polar"]},{"title": "[PART 4]: My Longest and Most In-Depth Polar Express/Back to the Future Theory to Date.", "selftext": "Please check out PART 3 before reading\u2026\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xnrp4/part_3_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1\n\nKing:\n\nhttps://static.wikia.nocookie.net/polarexpress/images/9/9e/Hobo.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130103024533\n\nKing, aka the Hobo, is Chris\u2019s paternal grandfather who died on the Polar Express sometime near the end of the Great Depression. Perhaps he was a neglectful husband who left his family to pursue another life. He may have helped conceive Chris\u2019s father before he left. Being poor, King rode on top of the Polar Express without buying a ticket. When the train drove into Flattop Tunnel, King was swept off and killed, causing him to haunt the train as a ghost. If you didn't know already, this backstory was revealed by the engineers in \u201cIt Takes Two.\u201dEven though this scene didn't make it into the final film, I think it\u2019s pretty easy to piece together King\u2019s backstory without it being explicitly said...\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3_yXRAjLEc0\n\nThe evidence I have for this part of the theory is that it is shown in the Back to the Future trilogy that a character\u2019s ancestors and descendants can look like their present self. Examples are Marty McFly\u2019s great-grandfather Seamus and future son Marty Jr. Other examples include Lorraine McFly\u2019s grandmother Maggie, Biff Tannen\u2019s great-grandfather Buford \u201cMad Dog,\u201d and Biff\u2019s future son Griff. Maybe the same logic applies to Chris\u2019s family, where Chris grows up to resemble his father and paternal grandfather. Tom Hanks plays all three characters, so it\u2019s not out of possibility.\n\nPART 5:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xo3gp/part_5_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1", "id": "12xo054", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xo054/part_4_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/", "created_utc": 1682353231.0, "score": 0, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/12xo054/part_4_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/", "comments": [], "URLs": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xnrp4/part_3_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1", "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/polarexpress/images/9/9e/Hobo.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130103024533", "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3_yXRAjLEc0", "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xo3gp/part_5_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1"], "html_title": ["r FanTheories comments part my longest and most indepth polar", "polarexpress images Hobo jpg revision latest", "The Polar Express Deleted Song - YouTube", "r FanTheories comments part my longest and most indepth polar"]},{"title": "[PART 3]: My Longest and Most In-Depth Polar Express/Back to the Future Theory to Date.", "selftext": "Read PART 2 of my theory before reading this part of it\u2026\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xnp0j/part_2_my_most_indepth_polar_expressback_to_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1\n\nThe Conductor:\n\nhttps://static.wikia.nocookie.net/polarexpress/images/0/07/Conductor.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130101015407\n\nThe Conductor is Chris, aka the Hero Boy, from the future. The central conflict of The Polar Express is Chris trying to preserve his belief in Santa Claus. At the beginning of the film, we see that he is starting to doubt Santa\u2019s existence. But what if he kept wondering about his existence into his adulthood? What if there was a part of him that never stopped believing in Santa Claus?\n\nOne night on Christmas Eve in the 1970s, Chris made a wish to meet Santa Claus. Santa, admiring his great-grandson\u2019s continued belief in the Christmas spirit, used magic to transport Chris across universes. Upon waking up at the North Pole, Chris met the Brown family and Santa Claus, and was overcome with joy. The man decided to make it his life\u2019s mission to spread happiness among children and took Doc\u2019s position as the train\u2019s conductor. After Doc retired from being the conductor (he felt that the great grandson of Santa Claus deserved to take his position), Chris used the Polar Express to travel through time and pick up kids worldwide. On one Christmas Eve, he traveled back to Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1957 to take himself to the North Pole. He wanted to give his doubtful younger self the chance to meet his great-grandfather like he did as an adult.\n\nThe evidence for the first part of the theory is that Chris and the Conductor are both played by Tom Hanks and wear blue clothing. The Conductor also seems to have a particular interest in Chris, almost like he sees himself in the young boy. There\u2019s even a moment where Chris gets a chocolate mustache that resembles the Conductor\u2019s, hinting at a possible connection between the two.\n\n*(NOTE: The wish factor was based on a similar theory from TV Tropes\u2026\nhttps://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/ThePolarExpress)*\n\nPART 4:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xo054/part_4_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1", "id": "12xnrp4", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xnrp4/part_3_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/", "created_utc": 1682352763.0, "score": 0, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/12xnrp4/part_3_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/", "comments": [], "URLs": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xnp0j/part_2_my_most_indepth_polar_expressback_to_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1", "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/polarexpress/images/0/07/Conductor.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130101015407", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/ThePolarExpress)*", "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xo054/part_4_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1"], "html_title": ["r FanTheories comments part my most indepth polar expressback to the", "polarexpress images Conductor jpg revision latest", "The Polar Express)* / WMG - TV Tropes", "r FanTheories comments part my longest and most indepth polar"]},{"title": "[PART 2]: My Most In-Depth Polar Express/Back to the Future Theory to Date.", "selftext": "Check out PART I of my theory before reading this\u2026\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xnnmr/my_most_indepth_polar_expressback_to_the_future/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1\n\nSmokey and Steamer:\n\nThe engineers are Doc Brown\u2019s grandchildren. The first bit of evidence is that they look similar to Jules and Verne. Now, I understand that Smokey has red hair while Jules\u2019 hair appears to be brown. But maybe Jules conceived him with the help of a red-haired woman in the Old West timeline. We don\u2019t know what Steamer\u2019s hair looks like since he is bald. But I think it\u2019s safe to say that he also has a red hair gene, as he and Smokey state that they are twins in a deleted scene called \u201cIt Takes Two.\u201d There\u2019s even concept art of the brothers standing with a tall red-haired woman, who may be their mother\u2026\n\nhttps://static.wixstatic.com/media/b51bcb_499e344cbe33b897b3f9bdd581fefa1d.jpg/v1/fill/w_1500,h_844,al_c,q_85,enc_auto/b51bcb_499e344cbe33b897b3f9bdd581fefa1d.jpg\n\nThe second piece of evidence is that Smokey has similar facial features to Doc Brown, right down to Emmett\u2019s infamous \u201cscreaming face.\u201d \n\nhttps://gottalovethemmovies.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_9456.jpg\n\nhttps://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bttf/images/9/96/Doc_Emmett_Brown.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220716093206\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/jjxYTtHG-0Q/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/iX8MKh9Sf2s/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nMaybe Doc\u2019s facial genes were passed on to Jules and his children. Another bit of evidence is that Smokey and Steamer speak in heavy southern accents, meaning they come from a background similar to Jules and Verne. \n\nPerhaps when he grew up, Jules travelled around the United States and eventually settled in southern Michigan sometime in the late 1910s. He chose to live in southern Michigan as it reminded him of his childhood home in Hill Valley, California. While staying there, he married a red-haired woman and gave birth to Smokey and Steamer in 1920.\n\nTo wrap this part of the theory up, the engineers are shown to be incredibly audacious and bright. They have a little girl operate the control hub while they put their lives at risk to install a new light bulb at the front of the train. If that\u2019s not enough, Steamer literally drives the Polar Express, a 444,300-pound steam locomotive, *across a frozen lake* without breaking a sweat!! That would take a LOT of bravery to do. These traits could be something they picked up from their grandfather, who is also very brave and risks his life multiple times throughout the Back to the Future trilogy to perform dangerous tasks. Another thing to add is that at least one of them (Smokey) is shown to be very resourceful when he uses a hairpin to fix the train\u2019s throttle. I could see Smokey and Steamer turning out goofy and venturesome like their grandfather.\n\nPART 3:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xnrp4/part_3_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1", "id": "12xnp0j", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xnp0j/part_2_my_most_indepth_polar_expressback_to_the/", "created_utc": 1682352610.0, "score": 0, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/12xnp0j/part_2_my_most_indepth_polar_expressback_to_the/", "comments": [], "URLs": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xnnmr/my_most_indepth_polar_expressback_to_the_future/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1", "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b51bcb_499e344cbe33b897b3f9bdd581fefa1d.jpg/v1/fill/w_1500,h_844,al_c,q_85,enc_auto/b51bcb_499e344cbe33b897b3f9bdd581fefa1d.jpg", "https://gottalovethemmovies.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_9456.jpg", "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bttf/images/9/96/Doc_Emmett_Brown.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220716093206", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jjxYTtHG-0Q/maxresdefault.jpg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iX8MKh9Sf2s/maxresdefault.jpg", "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xnrp4/part_3_my_longest_and_most_indepth_polar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1"], "html_title": ["r FanTheories comments my most indepth polar expressback to the future", "media jpg fill w h al c q enc auto jpg", "img jpg", "bttf images Doc Emmett Brown jpg revision latest", "vi jjxYTtHG maxresdefault jpg", "vi maxresdefault jpg", "r FanTheories comments part my longest and most indepth polar"]},{"title": "My Most In-Depth Polar Express/Back to the Future Theory to Date [PART I]", "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019ve posted many Back to the Future/Polar Express-related theories on this sub before, but I\u2019ve kept modifying and researching them to make an ultimate theory about both films.\n\nBefore we dive into it, I want to say that this theory is going to be split into 6 parts. At the end of every part, I will provide a link to the next one. I also want to add that this theory is going to sound VERY fanfictiony, as, admittedly, I wasn\u2019t able to find a whole lot of evidence to support it. But I just wanted to share this with the world and listen to any feedback I get.\n\nSo without further or do, let\u2019s dive in\u2026\n\n\nDoc Brown\u2019s Legacy and Connection with Santa Claus: \n\nAfter the events of Back to the Future III, Doc Brown developed technology that allowed people to hop across universes. In the late-1930s, Doc Brown and Clara discovered a magical realm inhabited by Santa Claus and his elves. They agreed to help him preserve the spirit of Christmas by taking kids to see him every Christmas Eve. \n\nDoc got in touch with his son, Jules Brown, who was living in southern Michigan with his wife and two sons, Smokey and Steamer. Living near the Pere Marquette Railway, Jules had access to a Baldwin 2-8-4 steam locomotive. So he bought it and converted it into a time train with the help of his father Emmett. Doc Brown then had his grandsons operate it while he conducted it. The reason he decided to conduct the train was because he wanted to spend the rest of his life making children happy. He was climbing up in age, and wanted to do as much good as possible before he died. The trio used the train to take kids from around the world to the North Pole yearly.\n\nAs for how Doc Brown built the Polar Express out of a Baldwin, he had enough technology lying around from all of the adventures he and his family went on. The two reasons for why the Polar Express looks like a regular Baldwin locomotive are aesthetic purposes and efficiency. Santa Claus wanted it to look old fashioned and dignified instead of futuristic and jumbled. So Doc incorporated the futuristic technology more subtly into the model to make it aesthetically pleasing to Santa and the children. Basically, he disguised the Polar Express as a regular steam engine. His craftsmanship also grew considerably since he built the Jules Verne Train at the end of Back to the Future III. \n\nIf you compare the Jules Verne Train to the Polar Express, the Jules Verne Train looks very much like a prototype with its flashing lights and futuristic gadgets on its outer frame (including a flux capacitor above the headlamp). It\u2019s very similar to an old automobile in that it's very bulky and cluttered. The Polar Express, meanwhile, is a lot more compact and sleek, which could be due to it being a more advanced model. Plus, the Jules Verne Train was designed after an 1897 Rogers 4-6-0 mixed traffic engine while the Polar Express was a 1931 Baldwin 2-8-4 steam locomotive. The Polar Express being a later train model would explain its different appearance.\n\nhttps://static.wikia.nocookie.net/universalstudios/images/2/2f/Back_to_the_Future_Jules_Vern_Train.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200728224130\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/68wj7gi1wa391.jpg\n\nI believe that as he gained more experience and resources throughout the years, Doc learned how to disguise time machines as regular vehicles to make them run more efficiently. Several design improvements included locating a flux capacitor inside the train\u2019s control cab and storing the rest of the machinery in the engine compartment. Essentially, the Polar Express is Doctor Emmett Brown\u2019s most advanced invention to date, possibly even the peak of his technological artistry.\n\nHowever, despite being a time machine, the Polar Express uses some degree of magic to function. For instance, it definitely uses magic to make tickets appear in children\u2019s pockets. However, the use of magic may also explain how the train travelled through Chris\u2019s neighborhood, stood on a frozen lake without sinking, and travelled on incredibly steep inclines. However, another explanation is that it uses some sort of hovering technology installed in its underside, like the Jules Verne Train.\n\nDoc Brown also constructed a railroad leading down Glacier Gulch, the steepest ravine in the world, to allow the Polar Express to get up to 888 miles per hour and generate 10.21 gigawatts of electricity. The reason for the higher speed and amount of electricity is to compensate for the train\u2019s greater weight and mass. As soon as it gets up to 888 miles per hour, it \u201cjumps\u201d to the North Pole. This happens at some point offscreen before the tracks flatten out and the train reaches the frozen lake. Even though the train\u2019s throttle broke and caused it to accelerate faster than it usually does, it still reached 888 miles per hour. It also happened instantaneously, in the blink of an eye. \n\nThe railroad may be located close to the North Pole in each timeline. The reason for this setup is that to get to the North Pole Realm, the train must drive up to the top of the world. It must line itself up geographically to effectively travel between universes, as Santa\u2019s realm is very similar to the North Pole in both timelines. The North Pole in both timelines acts as a gateway to the realm inhabited by Santa and his elves. The frozen lake is also located in the outskirts of the North Pole.\n\n*(NOTE: I\u2019m not the first to theorize about the Polar Express\u2019s hovering abilities and Glacier Gulch\u2019s purpose. Somebody else on this sub brought it up in their theory. But they deleted their account years ago, so I don\u2019t know their name. Several individuals like u/mattjammar have also theorized that the North Pole could be some sort of time bubble. However, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve ever called it a realm)*\n\n*(NOTE: Somebody named u/Noggin_and_Loggin already theorized the Polar Express losing its ability to travel through time)*\n\nPART 2:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xnp0j/part_2_my_most_indepth_polar_expressback_to_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1", "id": "12xnnmr", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xnnmr/my_most_indepth_polar_expressback_to_the_future/", "created_utc": 1682352528.0, "score": 0, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/12xnnmr/my_most_indepth_polar_expressback_to_the_future/", "comments": [], "URLs": ["https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/universalstudios/images/2/2f/Back_to_the_Future_Jules_Vern_Train.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200728224130", "https://i.redd.it/68wj7gi1wa391.jpg", "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xnp0j/part_2_my_most_indepth_polar_expressback_to_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1"], "html_title": ["universalstudios images Back to the Future Jules Vern Train jpg revision latest", "jpg", "r FanTheories comments part my most indepth polar expressback to the"]},{"title": "Voldemort is a confused Character", "selftext": "So my wife recently re-watched Harry Potter, all of it, and it got me thinking a few things. Firstly, im not a \"Fan\" of the series but I do have a theory. So if Im totally off base let me know. Secondly, I don't give Rowling much credit due to a lot of her (non-political) twitter takes about the series, where she feels the need to interject about the series to claim plotholes never happend or that she had planned things out well in advance when it seems pretty clear she did not.\n\nTHE THEORY:\nVoldemort is a very confusing character. The emotions you get from him are very simple, he is evil, racist, and power-hungry. All that is clear, however, I am not sure what his goal is. Does he want to take over the world? Ok sure, but Rowling has established that there's other Magical nations. The Ministry's full title is \"The MoM of Britian\", I think. So does he want to cleanse the \"impure\" of england? Sure, but its only non-purebloods? He teams up with a lot of creatures that the ministry is shown to be quite racist towards, such as the Centaurs and Giants.I've sren someone suggest that he just wants to be powerful and immortal, which is the coolest Idea i've heard but quite frankly I think that Idea is too complex for rowling. That Idea suggests he was written as a power-monger who exploited the Facist tendencies of the upper wizarding class to coup the govt and seize power so that he could... secure being immortal easier? We know he wants to kill Harry, at first it's spite, then it becomes a prophecy by book 3. Like honestly, besides being one of his lives, why does Harry matter? Just ignore him. Finally, Voldemort was said to have armies, includeing armies of zombies, prior to Harry being around, so it was a war right? Well not really? It was like a push for political power and they had gang wars with the Order of the Pheonix? \n\nSo, all this leads me to conclude, I think Voldemort was inspired by Sauron and Hitler. Rowling was inspired by these two and I think she merged them by having an \"ancient evil dark lord\" and a suave but evil political figure who can lead people to do evil things. So I think these two inspos being mashed together, along with what I suspect to be a lack of political literacy on J.K.'s part lead to Voldy being such a confusing villian beneath the surface. He serves he purpose fine for the story, however, I think readers will struggle to take away more from him than \"Bad Guy\"\n\n\nTL;DR: I think Voldemort is a fusion of Sauron and Hitler. While this seems interesting in concept, it ends up being confusing and I think a lack of planning is to blame.", "id": "12xeljm", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12xeljm/voldemort_is_a_confused_character/", "created_utc": 1682340478.0, "score": 16, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/12xeljm/voldemort_is_a_confused_character/", "comments": ["He's blatantly based on Hitler, who was himself rather confusing and contradictory.\n\nAs for why Voldemort wanted to kill Harry it was because he thought it would prove his superiority to avenge his only \"defeat\" against the \"chosen one\" and everyone would then see him as all powerful and fall in line. \n\nIt was for this same reason that he didn't want his underlings to kill Harry, he didn't want anyone else to gain the glory before he could prove that he was capable of defeating Harry himself.", "Interestingly the Potterverse has their own Hitler called Grindelwald.

He has the ruthlessness to get things done, but can't see beyond the immediate consequences of his ideas.\n\nI think Voldemort is intentionally a villain that isn't a great mastermind.

Her politics are neoliberal and presented rather immaturity (like you said, no structural change, it's not the systems fault). My honest feeling is the books never really \"matured with the audience\" like people say, they just kind of got longer with more deaths. Voldemort is just kind of another example of a poorly thought out character (which ironically makes him the perfect nemesis to an equally hollow protagonist)", "Voldemort to me always seemed like an entitled powerful idiot, letting everyone  know his plans to show off and then wining cause someone blow them up. An half blood that want's to destroy other halfbloods,so stupid that in the last book he let his minions approve a law that could affect him too.", "Voldemort allying with non-pureblood magical races such as centaurs and giants has historical precedent.  During WWII, while shouting the superiority of \"Aryans\", Hitler used common enemies of the British Empire and Soviet Union as allies.  There was an Muslim Bosian Waffen SS division (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_Waffen_Mountain_Division_of_the_SS_Handschar_(1st_Croatian), the Germans and Irish Republican Army tried to make plans (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army%E2%80%93Abwehr_collaboration), and even an Indian Waffen SS (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Legion).  Each group had its own goals and motivations that Germany hoped to used against a common enemy (challenge failed).  War makes for strange bed fellows (see France and Britian, and, USA and USSR on the Allied side).", "There\u2019s absolutely no way to argue that she had the whole arc planned out or that the characters are more complex than your standard archetypes and stereotypes. The movies did her a huge favor wallpapering over poor writing and fixing errors. Here\u2019s the big secret: the target audience for the books was and is children. You can get away with literally anything in children\u2019s fantasy. Try reading those books 20 years later and convince me you still think they are not just interesting but well written. I know this isn\u2019t an argument against what you wrote, more of an affirmation. \n\nMain point is, I know people go crazy for Harry Potter stuff, but it was never that complicated. Im not saying it\u2019s a bad business model! Look at the big franchises today. HP, Star Wars, MCU, Spider-Man, DC, Pirates, Pokemon, even the mighty Disney. They all started and grew as entertainment for children. Children have more time to consume content. They are uncritical and very enthusiastic about what they love. Turns out they will carry that fandom forward for decades. There\u2019s a limit; it can\u2019t feel like it\u2019s for children below a certain age and nostalgia only goes back so far. Don\u2019t expect a multi-billion dollar Teletubbies movie to come out even though that target audience has aged into having money.", "Voldemort is a clear allegory of Hitler and his rise to power. I mean Voldemort is a half-blood, like how Hitler is half Jewish.", "I welcome challenges to this idea based in deeper Harry Potter lore, however, if this lore is not from the books or movies I will think lesser of it. If its not present while reading, a Newb wouldnt know that info by reading the book as intended.", "The way harry potter is written is by taking real world problems and adding a magic twist to them. For example instead of racism there are people against werewolves, askaban is like alketras, and so on. Voltemort is meant to be the gamic version of hitler. His only goal is to be immortal. He doesn't have the ability to love, so he has no fear of anything other than death. He doesn't see value in sacrifice, taking one for the team, showing gratitude, or anything of the sorts. He only has one fear which is death, all he cares about is himself, if he were to lose himself what would he have left? If he can abolish his only weakness, that is keeping him similar to other humans, then that would make him the truly strongest wizard to ever live, and no one could change that. Or at least I think that's what he wants lol \ud83d\ude05", " It states pretty clearly several times that Voldemort is simply afraid of death. That's his main goal - to master death with power, fear and violence. The irony is that his greatest enemy (Harry) becomes the master of death not through these means, but because of love. Voldemort secured his own death and defeat through the very act of trying to kill Harry.", "Right but thats where I think he clashes a bit. The elements of the Story that involve the Coup are fairly straight forward, however, the elements of Voldemort assembling an army read a lot more like the \"Dark Lord\" trope. It leaves me questioning if hes trying to Conquer like Sauron or if he wants to play politics. Death Eaters definately play a \"Brown shirt\" role, however they also act a lot like an Army. This can be true and the point i just find that to be disjointed.\n\nAlso Making Voldemort Hitler kinda exposes how J.K. doesnt really understand Hitler because the MoM and Order of the Phoenix really do nothing to prevent future Tom Riddles after the \"Wizarding War*\"(*Battle).", "Thats to my point. I think a Small re-write of Voldemort would help the plot greatly, dropping the outward goal of racial purity would help out a lot by making him the \"evil lord\" who wants to take over the (wizarding) world .", "The best summary of the series I've ever heard, \"(the books) just kind of got longer with more deaths\". \n\nThere is no real character development, so we don't learn more about the characters in any meaningful way.", "Lol good to see you share the sentiment. Yeah I dont only blame NeoLib Rowling, I think that Voldemort is the \"Bad Guy\" and being evil for evil's sake could be a fine plot element. However, JoAnne incorperates the Nazis and this detracts from that element because that is a waaaaay more complicated story\n\nEdit: Oh and actually, you just finished book 5. Umbridge demonstrates extremely clearly that there are severe structural problems with the MoM in how it treats certian magical creatures. However, by series end and even the end of book 5 its presented as \"Umbridge is just a massive bitch\"", "True in that regard, however This situation would be more analagous to Hitler employing Jews in the Brown Shirts", "I always thought HP started that way, but once she realized that her books had major appeal to the YA and Adult demographic she steered whole hog into the books being mature, which is why readers could expect a bit more from her writing.\n\n But yeah, I think before the politics, her most infuriating trait was her inability to be seen as anything else than a super genius that planned everything out from the beginning.

Although some Jews did serve in the German military in WWII, was under Hitler's nose.  Rowling tried making a villian based off Hitler/thr Nazis, which George Lucas had done before and better.  \n\nNot the first time a bigot has gotten their metaphors mixed up.  See Butch Hartman and accidental LGBTQIA+ themes in his cartoons...", "That's true, but then again that's out of character. We all have a conscience no matter how bad you are. Even hitler did, at the end of the day he (claimed) was doing it all for the pride of Germany. However since voldemort couldn't feel those emotions, no sense of guilt or questioning would ever go on him. He would regularly kill multiple families on a daily basis with no remorse after all. He can technically be considered the most selfish character ever created in any novel. He holds the same trait that powered many other evil dictators, and was the cause of many tragedies in humanity over all, which was his pride. Pride in himself, and what he saw that he deserved, he practically considered himself a god by the time Dumbledore was killed, it also feels like he was power hungry, and had put all that he had into being immortal. It's like he didn't want his efforts to go to waste. I could never imagine voldemort putting his wand down and surrendering, or going to live in peace and solitude, he wanted to be worshiped. And it's that striking complex we see between him and Dumbledore that creates such a cool dynamic. Dumbledore loved, and put care and loyalty into others as his first priority, he was always slow to anger, and never cared weather his life was at risk as long as he could keep his lived ones safe, and fight for the truth. In result he lived a long glorified life, to 116 years, with many achievements, gretaly loved, and died being the owner of the elder's wand. While voldemort who seeked an infinite life by killing and domination, without any care or conscience for any other humans, caused him to die at 71, most of those years he couldn't even function by himself because of the fight he had with baby harry. Not to mention how from the second he left hogwarts as a teenager, he felt no joy or satisfaction in his life. He sought immortality, and got a short life. Dumbledore sought love and justice, and got what he didn't even look for, yet his enemies were loving to achieve. But at the same time it also just makes a better story, and a great time burner to get into lol \ud83e\udd2a.

A lot of people who say we didn't get enough explanation of why Luke changed are viewing the franchise backwards in time. We got so little for answers as to why Luke and Yoda were in exile during the original trilogy or about much of anything really.  Most of the answers came in the form of the prequels.

Like, yeah, I don't want this, or I would have brought it with me lol.", "Frankly, OP's theory is a stretch and holds no merit other than \"but you can't prove he's NOT a clone!\" Luke's personality is the most logical and sensible part of the sequel trilogy imo. To add to your examples, it's the Anakin in him coming through. The brooding cry baby part of him took over after he was defeated, but he doesn't have Anakin's rage to keep him going. He knows retaliation with almost no resources will only make things worse. So he sits there in seclusion, drinking milk. Very similar to what happened with Yoda on Dagobah. Yoda was a kooky old jerk, very different from the Yoda we'd see in later media. His self imposed isolation made him that way. Luke needed to go into hiding while everything else progressed to save every lone and everything he cared about. Yoda just ran for his life and stayed there, which can be a semantic argument against the use of (the) force against your enemies. Retaliation would have been based in emotions that all lead to the dark side. I'm done pooping now so this is where my counterpoint ends", "I strongly disagree. Luke was very confident in ROTJ, which is the last time we see him and before he begins to expand his knowledge of the Jedi. If you recall, Yoda only considered him a Jedi *after* he confronts Darth Vader. Thus, he should be more sure of himself, and continue to become more detached as Lucas intended the Jedi to be\n\nThe portrayal of Luke in TLJ disregards ROTJ, the EU, Obi-Wan and Yoda\u2019s portrayals, and fan expectations. I don\u2019t expect directors to follow fan expectations or the EU necessarily, but when Luke\u2019s legacy has been slowly built upon for literal decades its as much a part of him as the movies. \n\nSo throwing out his legacy and making him \u201crelatable\u201d was a poor move in this case. Few movies have the chance to portray a legend to this degree, someone fans have been hyped to see for decades. To portray the movie as an epic, with Luke as a wise master would have been peak cinema. The excitement to see Luke again was incredible, and yet all of that excitement just deflated when he threw that lightsaber away. Then he was just another old guy in a movie", "I think with some more in-between materials sure this could work out but Luke is so wildly different, I don't really buy that explanation. Plus he literally has the power to see good in people. No matter what, so it makes zero sense for him to turn on Kylo. Luke saw good in the most messed up, morally bankrupt, irredeemable space Hitler and proved it. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong and missing something. I'd like to know more.", "Also just like...we've SEEN first hand what being an old hermit does to Jedi. We saw it with Obi-Wan, we REALLY saw it with Yoda. Luke being well adjusted after living alone with the fish nuns and drinking nothing but a clearly different type of blue milk would have been much less explainable than him becoming a weirdo.", "It's also the second half of the hero's journey. Straight out of Campbell. Pure, unadulterated Star Wars. \n\nNot only did obi and Yoda go through it. But so did Arthur, Bilbo and countless other aged heroes.", "Yes!! Thank you!!\n\nI honestly love Luke in the sequel trilogy for this reason. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really enjoy Luke in the originals too. But he is more of a quintessential hero there.

We know nothing about the events that happened after Return of the Jedi. He even references the events of the Clone Wars to justify his position, events he wasn't even alive for.\n\nLuke most certainly can and should change after 30 years. But there was nothing building up to it. That's the biggest failing in his character development.\n\nI'm not disagreeing with you in the **least** bit - I **do** agree with you!

Abrams' skillset is decidedly in the center of pure homage, whether it's Alias or even Lost to Star Trek to Cloverfield to Star Wars. Johnson tends to work within set parameters but loves undoing things from the inside (the donut within the donut, if you will). Abrams sets up this huge melodramatic moment at the end of TFA, which was a very Abrams thing to do. But it's also a very Johnson thing to do to have Luke toss it. \n\nI know the two directors supposedly talked quite a bit, but it really feels like a game of telephone, and the toss feels like the worst of it - almost like a Benny Hill scene to me.", "You don\u2019t think people have the capacity to change in like 30 years?

He was confident as a jedi, but how does that mean that he\u2019d be a good teacher. It\u2019s two separate things. Life is not a linear path.", "I hear you. A few retort points:\n\n1. That version of Luke exists in all the comics and EU, so fans def got what they wanted. That version of Luke also exists at the end of TLJ, where Luke is both wise and powerful *and* sacrificial in all the right ways. Also, I think both Yoda and Obi-Wan routinely doubt Luke's ability, from ESB to ROTJ. They hide things from him, they talk behind his back - and this makes sense because they've already seen what happens to one chosen one. \n \n2. I think if you follow your line of thinking where we roll straight into that version into TLJ, we would have ended up with a Superman or Captain Marvel situation where you have a super buff OP character with no flaws. Fun maybe for fans, but honestly boring for a movie, and hard to explain - if you have the rise of a new dark power, why isn't Luke showing up? And if he does show up, and he is in fact this superpower Jedi, you either have to make the bad side extra extra powerful to create conflict, or you have to kryptonite/debuff Luke. What we end up with is a version where Luke debuffs himself. It's a choice of his own making, which is agency really, even if we disagree with Luke's decision.\n\n3. I disagree that Luke was ready at the end of ROTJ. Remember that most Jedi, even Anakin the chosen one, were trained from near-birth (or in Anakin's case, as young as possible). Luke gets what...a few weeks training from Yoda, and then some DIY training between ESB and ROTJ? And Luke comes real close to switching to the dark side. Even Yoda and Obi-Wan and the entire Jedi council didn't forsee their own demise (which is why, along with safety reasons, they also cut out and self-exile). \n\nI don't think all the above makes him relatable, and I don't think the point was to make him relatable. I am guessing Johnson quite pragmatically needed a way to explain the setup, which was that Luke is gone, the dark side is rising, and Kylo Ren exists - in order to connect the dots, almost the only plausible explanation is that Luke has gone into exile.", "Obi-Wan and Yoda were both confident in one movie and then the next time they showed up were middle/late aged disenchanted grumpy sentients.  How is it so improbable that Luke ended up the same way that both of his previous masters did?", "Lmao look at any teenager and them 30 years later, they are gonna be disillusioned and grumpy about the direction the world (err, Galaxy) has gone. And the whole point was that he was exposed to a fresh view in Rey and was able to come back to his ways. Why do people act like Luke went out in his same old grump way from the beginning of the film?", "Why would Luke be a hermit like Yoda though? They were just forcing all the original events from the OT without a story to back it up. There was no galactic empire which jedi had to hide from, there was an active government with his friends and family running it and in just as much danger as him, and were now in that danger without his help.\n\nLuke really only had two character traits in the original trilogy - he always ran into danger to help friends and family while others screamed at him not to, at least two or three times in every movie, and was so attached to the idea of family that he'd rather die than strike down his father even when goaded into it by the most evil manipulator in the galaxy.\n\nThen in the sequels he nearly kills his nephew due to sensing some darkness and then runs away from his friends and family... There's just nothing there to indicate he's the same character other than the name and the actor's face. No consistency for how he went from the guy who repeatedly showed his personality in the OT to this random unrelated person in the sequels.", "Only works if he was being made as a decoy luke, but that could work - padme did it", "Why would they remove the flesh covering from his hand, showing definitely it was a robot hand, rather than leaving it ambiguous? \n\nIf he had 2 normal looking hands nobody would've thought anything of it because we saw the robot hand appeared the same at the end of the empire strikes back", "I don't understand why I would hide a decoy at the far end of the galaxy and cut the map to him into pieces.

This is why he exiled himself.\n\nAs for his understanding of how the Jedi fell the first time, well we know he trained with Obi Wan and Yoda and could commune with them and his father after their deaths, there's no reason to assume he didn't have access to this info. We've seen since that he was also advised by Ahsoka (but that's no comment on the movie that was made first obviously). After his own failure led to Kylo Ren and the rise of the First Order, his understanding of history and seeing it as repeating itself taught him the wrong lesson, which is something Yoda points out to him.\n\nI think the movie spelled out everything it needed to in order to explain how Luke got to this point in his life, I just think after so much time had passed, so much expanded universe content mythologising the character, and TFA leaning hard into that myth, some fans just could handle that whiplash, had an emotional response, and there's no explaiming to an emotional response how it's got the wrong end of the stick so the whiplash became vitriolic backlash.", "That\u2019s why I think Filoni might be trying to fix it.

They also reportedly tried to cut out and change the look of 'ghost' scenes to get it to air in China (joke's on them, all the SW movies flopped in China where they couldn't rely on 'remember the original trilogy?' nostalgia bait which drove the Disney sequels, and now China has banned outside movies).", "Dude they are a corporation, it\u2019s about money.", "So basically they are pulling a George Lucas with the prequels then", "But it\u2019s been kind of working?", "(I did, thank you)\n\nI would agree with you about Johnson undoing thongs from the inside if not for the ultimate conclusions that nearly every character comes to in the film. Yes the movie takes apart and examines a lot about the franchise, questioning if it's all been worth it over the years, but from Luke's return to Rey keeping the Jedi texts at the end (a detail im certain a lot of people unhappy with the movie missed at the time) the movie is proudly about how great the franchise is and how positive the stories it can tell can be. I think you can tell that story without seemingly disrespectful and silly things like tossing the lightsaber, but it won't have the same impact as a story that makes you examine the subject, shows that it doesn't HAVE to take itself seriously, and shows you why it's worth WANTING to take itself and it's messages seriously.", "It's not that it's impossible, its the decision to portray him as such.

While that is true that Luke existed in that capacity for a long time, but it's not a good reason to avoid portraying him as he was\n2. Again, I would disagree. I don't understand this rhetoric about power, it doesn't necessarily make for a boring movie, that's just the excuse to avoid powerful characters. Captain Marvel's issue wasn't her being powerful, and Superman has existed for over 80 years and people still enjoy his character. Showing fans' childhood hero as a powerful Jedi would be enjoyable, and not an issue for the story. For one, Luke isn't superman-level. And secondly, he's facing an entire imperial remnant. He's not going to kill them all at once, which is the narrative spewed about Luke's minimal role. The First Order was not below Luke to fight. Luke still fits into the world and could have been a part of the story, but they decided to side-line him and neglect his role. When they were writing TFA, Michael Arndt said \"\u201cIt just felt like every time Luke came in and entered the movie, he just took it over.\u00a0Suddenly you didn\u2019t care about your main character anymore because, \u2018Oh f\u2013k, Luke Skywalker\u2019s here. I want to see what he\u2019s\u00a0going to do.\u2019\u201d His portrayal was more to glorify the new protagonists rather than to adapt Luke as a Jedi Grandmaster\n3.

They never became disconnected from the force or rejected the Jedi, and remained confident in themselves as Jedi. Yoda wasn\u2019t crumbling underneath the weight of peoples\u2019 expectations, neither was Obi-Wan. They were content with who they were, only Yoda could be seen as mildly grumpy\n\nWhen Luke talks to Yoda, he\u2019s initially hesitant to train him due to Anakin\u2019s fall. But that doesn\u2019t correlate to Yoda\u2019s views upon the force whatsoever. Luke however, totally rejects the Jedi and the force.

I can infer how it happened from context but there *is* a lot of story in between TROJ and TLJ that is delivered expositorially. I think the new series are doing a good job of filling in that time and providing a context for how we got to the sequel trilogy.\n\nThe lack of planning is evident, but I stand by The Last Jedi being a good film and Luke's attitude making sense given the information we get.

I was hoping for a character study of the man behind the mask. \n\nOnce the re-introduction of Thrawn was green-lit, it became paramount to move the pieces into place, which meant getting Mandalore under Mandalorian authority. This meant focusing on Bo-Katan, the primary vehicle for the overarching Mandalorian story. This, coupled with the fact the Pedro Pascal was rarely on-set to provide a performance, meant Din Djarin's character development took a back seat. \n\nI'm also convinced the cloning plot **was** for Palpatine and Snoke, but was re-worked for season 3. It was dealt with quickly and unceremoniously, the plot being revealed only after it was eliminated. \n\nIn short, I strongly suspect they compromised the integrity of their original vision for The Mandalorian in favor of other stories. But production was undoubtedly effected by real-world limitations, too. So my faith is a little shaken. That said, I love Dave Filoni, and will gladly eat up anything he dishes out. :)", "Only Disney knows for sure, but logically, if they first movie doesn't do well, teay can just treat it as a stand alone, like Solo. But if they announce its the first of a new Star Wars they are committed, they can't not make the other two.

And then the empire was formed out of it, and that went most or all the way over there. I could swear that our current timeline  matches with the ending of the Star Wars Republic and the beginning of the Empire. I see that happening with those in power deceiving citizens just like in how the Star Wars Empire was. If we are to continue existing for another generation and some citizens find out the truth, then a future rebellion would happen in a way that's no different to the rebellion that took place in Star Wars. I can easily compare these timelines from Star Wars to real-life when disinformation, trying to find truth and fight back, and so on becomes a reality and isn't just limited to a fictional series. I'd say that we'd be currently living in Espisode 3, or potentially the Bad Batch series, or about to anyway. If I just keep track of possible future government raids taking place, that is. Those who know the truth, such as me, could end up becoming the future rebels and hopefully win against the curropt regime. That Order 66 may have kinda started, but they still have yet to go all in for whatever reason, but a massive number of people will be called traitors to the regime because whos truely good must be taken out of power or eliminated from life. If a rebellion comes, they'd also be called traitors or a threat to so-called woke, but those who know sin and resist it as well as know what's evil and truth are those who're truely awake and are already being considered as threats and traitors today anyway. But I'm not surprised, for I know that the world likes sin and will always hate those who're godly since they try to get rid of sin and keep or spread around what is good and truth when the world would rather believe in lies and accept what's not good. Every sin is bad or evil anyway. Watch for those who promote such bad things, for only they'll be visible everywhere and liked, even if not by everyone, just the right people, who're also ungodly, and get it spread and promoted throughout the whole world like it's a good and true thing. Meanwhile, those who're truly good and give what is truely good to everyone are those who can be liked by most people since most people would generally like what's good, but they're hated by those in power and are almost never shown on media because of it. That's how it works, maybe not all of it, but this should be enough explanation. Besides, if who mainstream media calls woke engages in bad things (sins) that have really been proven by unbiased science to be bad in the long-term, then those people are frauds in claiming to be truely woke.

You also sound like, if you're a citizen in Star Wars, you'd also easily buy into the Jedi being traitors nonsense and end up being a loyal citizen of the empire.

They're evil and try to control the world the secret and it all sounds like conspiracies, but they openly promote wrongful doings that they make everyone to believe is good, but has been proven otherwise by scientists that'll never be well known or liked enough to be so. This is how I see it as no different. Also, in Star Wars, this was predicted by the Force. In real life, this was predicted by the Bible.

He's in the minds of those in control, which is why they promote things that aren't truely good, but rather bad in the long-run of using them. He slowly kills off bodies.

Anyway, who's really in control? Why did the FDA sue some water investigation company for finding some bad stuff in our drinks? Why when the CDC back in 1999 found out that something dentists use to clean teeth would only clean teeth if directly applied instead of drinken through our water and could even do harm in the long-term, being put into every possible drinking water in the US? To help Big Pharma earn money from more sick and disabled people? If they're truely good and not sided with the evil one, then why do they ignore basic biology and promote sexual sins? Why do they disinformationize real good things that I can only find Dark Age Defense selling in secret? Because they're scams? Then what about the bad stuff they brought up? Misinformation? Then why can I easily find pieces or a large amount to be true through simple internet searches about events and reports? This evil one is the Anti-Christ or Satan. Now I suppose you'll be asking for links. This never gets old, but I can't just expect people to just do their own searches.

The tale has a beginning, a middle, and end with some of the most efficient scene setting I've ever seen. The only information on the setting we're given is \"I was cuttin' a rug at a place called The Jug\" but nonetheless you know everything you need to know about the place and the crowd. Bonus points that it's supposedly based on a true incident.\n\nAs such, I've spent an unusual (perhaps unhealthy) amount of time thinking about the song. The source of the conflict and comedy is the \"fella with the hair colored yellow\" (the narrator) being threatened with\"a .44\" by Mr. Linda Lou (we never get his name) for dancing with Linda Lou. What's interesting is that though the two men confront each other, trading dialogue, we never hear a word from the object of their affection. Sure, maybe she's passive or terrified of her gun wielding boyfriend/husband, but it's odd she never speaks up for the narrator (\"You leave him alone!\") or throws him under the bus (\"Thank God you're here to save me!\"). Instead she remains silent until the confrontation comes to a head and she screams to give the narrator \"the break I was looking for\" so he can escape. \n\nI propose this is because she's enjoying the whole thing, savoring every second.\n\nWhat's also odd is that no one in the crowded bar steps up to defuse the situation. No patrons try to calm down Mr. Linda Lou. No one calls the cops. The bartender doesn't draw the sawed-off shotgun that \"The Jug\" inevitably has under the counter and tell them to take it outside. That's because everyone, at least all the regulars at The Jug, know what's up. This is a regular thing, maybe monthly, where Linda Lou looks to spice up her and Mr.'s love life. She heads down to The Jug, flirts up a storm with a good looking out of towner and then calls Mr. Linda Lou on the payphone by the women's room (remember, 1970s). She either mocks him or begs for rescue, depending on what will rile up the adrenaline more.\n\nHeck, even Mr. Linda Lou knows what's up. The line \"That's my woman there and I'm a man who cares and that might be all for you!\" isn't intended for the Fella With the Hair Colored Yellow. It's for Linda Lou. She just got to flirt with a good looking guy (showing she's \"still got it\"), provoked the man in her life into a fight, got a taste of danger (\"Oh, that's *such* a big gun...\"), and got her man to make a public profession that he isn't just willing to fight for her (the bare minimum for maintaining a relationship if you're a regular at The Jug) but that he *cares* for her. It's everything a person with the right kind of kinks could ever want! When she screams it isn't because she's worried about the narrator or anyone getting hurt. She's sending him on his way because she's done with him and wants some time with Mr. Linda Lou.\n\nAnd 30 seconds after the terrified narrator runs screaming into the night, the jukebox starts to play (\"Free bird,\" perhaps?) and people at the bar start to giggle as the Linda Lous excuse themselves. And every regular at The Jug knows not to go near the parking lot for the next hour or so as that other great 1970s saying plays itself out...\n\n\"If this van's a rockin', don't come knockin'!\"\n\nEdit: Cleanup.", "id": "12x1bxp", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12x1bxp/gimme_three_steps_linda_lou_set_the_whole_thing_up/", "created_utc": 1682306612.0, "score": 11, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/12x1bxp/gimme_three_steps_linda_lou_set_the_whole_thing_up/", "comments": ["Overall I think it\u2019s a very solid theory.

Let\u2019s delve into this further.\n\nDamon Gant has lots of parallel connections with the Special Investigation Unit in Ghost Trick that are too interleaved in many respects to pass off as mere coincidences. Gant clearly knows something about the Fey clan, sure, but where does Manfred fit in? Let\u2019s consider their characters.\n\n1. Both men are likely around the same age, meaning they likely were brought up in the same educational system and were familiar with each other in their respective fields. One could argue that the two may have even been partners before Gant rose to Chief of Police status prior to the events of Ace Attorney.\n2. Manfred\u2019s obsession with perfection and how it connects to Gant. Gant\u2019s ID number is littered with sevens, which in and of themselves are symbolic of perfection, which is literally the Von Karma mantra to a T. Manfred is clearly fixated on perfection just like Gant, but why is this the case?\n3. Manfred von Karma has connections to Ernest Amano, a likely member of the shadow network. Ernest Amano\u2019s Amano Group was also able to steal evidence that could have been used to indict Manny Coachen for Cece Yew\u2019s murder, which brings me to the last hidden connection\n4. Why Manfred got away with stun-gunning Phoenix and Maya straight-up in the evidence room in 1-4 and absconding with the key evidence incriminating him? Simply put, Gant was still Chief of Police at the time, and Gant likely helped his friend Manfred with open arms. Gant likely also did the same after the events of DL-6 by allowing Manfred to take a vacation with the missing bullet any detective worth their salt could have known someone had taken away with them from the scene.\n\nOn a further note, let\u2019s examine Von Karma\u2019s penalty given AAI2-3 by Blaise Debeste. In this case, we discover that Rip Lacer was taken off as initial investigator of Isaac Dover\u2019s murder following Dover\u2019s body disappearing before von Karma showed up to officially investigate. Despite this fact, Rip was still left in charge of interrogations. This also led to Tyrell Badd slipping von Karma\u2019s coercion against Master in Badd\u2019s recording of Rip Lacer\u2019s interrogation of Master to Gregory Edgeworth.\n\nSo where\u2019s the tie-in to Damon Gant here with Manfred von Karma and Rip Lacer? Well, a body going missing and the lead investigator still being in charge of interrogations despite being taken off means that someone high up on the investigative ladder must have been involved somehow, and that person couldn't have been Blaise Debeste, or the man who gave Manfred von Karma the penalty. The reason why we know this is because Rip is clearly not in league with Blaise given how the latter fires him for coercing a false confession from Master. In other words, Manfred and Gant were the ones who coerced the false confession and not Blaise.\n\nWell, I can provide a tie-in to Gant here with Manfred and Rip, since prior to SL-9, we know that Gant was technically the undersheriff, or Deputy Chief of Police, of Japanifornia. This would allow him the necessary political law enforcement clout to keep Rip Lacer still present regarding prisoner interrogations, even if Rip himself were taken off the actual case as lead detective against Master in the IS-7 Incident.\n\nIf this is true, this shows that von Karma and Gant have been working together for quite some time now. This also makes the judge in Phoenix\u2019s cases come to mind, since both of these men seem to have a strong pull on the judge and his decision making process.\n\nBoth men likely have their own dirt on the judge in addition to many others, which allows them to have the legal system under their collective thumb. But then this does beg the question: What was the goal of these two men?\n\nBoth seem to want to get criminals like Joe Darke off the streets as quick as possible to avoid causing nationwide panic, yet at the same time, these men don\u2019t seem to care if they imprison or brutally interrogate innocent people for crimes that they didn\u2019t commit with the assistance of someone corrupt like Rip Lacer. Something smells of massive paranoia here between these two men. It\u2019s almost as if the two were afraid of something, but what could they both possibly be afraid of, given their high political connections? I'd argue that Blaise Debeste is the main source of their worries, since even he was above Lana Skye in terms of power given his connections as the Head Chairman of the Prosecutorial Investigative Committee, but I'll get into that more.\n\nFirstly, let's suppose that the Cohdopian Smuggling Ring by Quercus Alba also holds connections to Gant and von Karma through von Karma's connections to Ernest Amano in the Amano Group. In other words, let\u2019s assume von Karma and Gant were key political figures necessary to this organization in going against the Republic of Zheng Fa, and Ernest Amano was their moneyman for Alba. The main question is why do these men attack the Republic of Zheng Fa so much?\n\nWell, according to the fandom wiki on Zheng Fa, we know that Zheng Fa holds symbolic connections to China. We also know that China as a government has a high emphasis in using technology to boost their economic prosperity. We also know that Dane Gustavia\u2019s confectionery skills (aesthetically speaking anyway) vastly improved upon training in this country for 3 years. This shows that Zheng Fa has great technological prowess in its ability as a country compared to others.\n\nNow, how does this connect to Ghost Trick? Well, what if the people led by Commander Sith (i.e. the blue/green-skinned assassins and kidnappers) are people from the Republic of Zheng Fa working for the corrupt Commander Sith? What if Commander Sith is actually the one running the show in the Republic of Zheng Fa, and the President of Zheng Fa (the body double that Blaise and Roland replaced after having Dogen assassinate the real president) is just following Sith's own orders directly as a puppet?\n\nThis would mean, even if Damon and Manfred helped take down the economic government of Zheng Fa with the help of the Amano Group and the Cohdopian Smuggling Ring, Commander Sith was their real enemy all along that they were fighting against. In other words, by Phoenix Wright taking out these two men and by Miles Edgeworth taking down the Cohdopian Smuggling Ring, both men unwittingly took down key figureheads standing in the way of Commander Sith\u2019s plot without even realizing it. This wound up giving Blaise's group that much more power internationally.\n\nAfter all, let\u2019s consider Manfred\u2019s breakdown against Edgeworth telling him how he\u2019s going to bury him with his bare hands. Now, that\u2019s a very specific line that almost belies something about Manfred\u2019s state of mind. Manfred knows more than he\u2019s letting on here, so what did he mean by that?\n\nWell, it seems like it wasn't literal on first glance since Manfred dies in JFA and Edgeworth is still alive, so what else could Manfred have possibly meant? Well, let\u2019s consider that Manfred, through his connections to the Amano Group made Edgeworth into who he was as a prosecutor at least partially.\n\nPerhaps Manfred referred to what could be ascribed as Edgeworth\u2019s symbolic death that we see in JFA. In other words, Manfred knows that he is still leaving on a legacy with Edgeworth, and that he is essentially burying the \u201cvon Karma\u201d part of him that Manfred endowed him with.\n\nLet\u2019s also consider why Manfred wants to convict Edgeworth so badly. It\u2019s easy to point at only DL-6 at this point and say that Manfred wanted Edgeworth to pay solely because of that, but I think one can come up with other justifiable reasons for Manfred's ire against Edgeworth. As a matter of fact, it was far riskier for Manfred to make such a personal vendetta out of the whole thing rather than let his friend Gant handle things as Chief of Police. So why did Manfred go after Edgeworth so much in 1-4? Was the bullet Miles left in Manfred\u2019s shoulder really as much of a scar as Manfred lets on?\n\nFor the answer to these questions, let\u2019s consider Manfred\u2019s quest for perfection, and how it ties into his connections that we've previously established as well as DL-6. Prior to Gregory giving him his penalty and Miles shooting him in the shoulder, von Karma was arguably \u201cperfect\u201d in every sense of the word in the legal system as a prosecutor. Ignore the forgeries and false confessions the man got for a second and consider his reputation before Blaise gave him the penalty. The fact of the matter is that von Karma was unable to become a viable Chief Prosecutor whatsoever following Blaise's penalty against him, and Damon Gant appointed Lana Skye, a woman he was blackmailing, into that position instead. But even Gant couldn't compete with Blaise's Chairman position as Chief Prosecutor, highlighting how much of a pull Blaise had over even these two powerful men in the legal system.\n\nThis suggests clear implications. Namely, DL-6 had ramifications on Manfred\u2019s legal career in the possibility of Manfred rivaling Blaise as a prosecutor. As a result of Gregory's actions against him, Manfred couldn\u2019t remove the obvious blemish on his record and rise the ranks of Chief Chairman Prosecutor rivaling Blaise similar to how Gant rose to Chief of Police. This is important in how it highlights that von Karma and Gant started out similarly, yet Gant was the one who wound up with more power in the end because of von Karma's penalty given to him by Blaise. The penalty was a power move that Gregory, albeit unintentionally, made to von Karma that tipped the scales from von Karma to Blaise Debeste. Both Blaise and von Karma are clearly evil men, but arguably Blaise Debeste was the more \"evil\" one, especially considering his crimes compared to those of von Karma. Blaise even talks trash about Manfred on many occasions in AAI2, which only highlights how far away from Blaise Manfred actually was on the prosecutorial ladder.\n\nIn other words, that \u201cpenalty\u201d wasn\u2019t simply a penalty to Manfred. It destroyed a goal to Manfred, or an ideal, that he was striving for alongside Gant. The ideal of molding the legal system into something. But what was Manfred trying to mold the legal system into?\n\nOne only needs to look into the Zheng Fa culture and its \u201cphilosophy of detainment\u201d to see how Gant mirrors similar practices regarding the arrest of Joe Darke. Despite numerous investigations done on the man, Gant couldn\u2019t pin Darke to the crimes of SL-9. Darke instead had to walk in directly and confess to the crimes for Gant to be able to detain him for questioning alongside Neil Marshall. In other words, Gant and von Karma clearly both would rather detain suspicious parties like in Zheng Fa rather than simply let them walk because of due process.\n\nLet\u2019s also consider the circumstances behind Blaise Debeste giving von Karma that penalty. This action clearly shows that Blaise and von Karma were not in cahoots, and that the presidential assassination Blaise did to the actual President of Zheng Fa did was most definitely not supported by von Karma or Gant. In other words, maybe von Karma was trying the entire time to oppose Blaise\u2019s position as Chief Chairman Prosecutor through acting as \"perfect\" as he could throughout the legal system to rival Blaise, but Gregory Edgeworth ruined Manfred's reputation by exposing Manfred\u2019s own corruption (which, although terrible, was arguably lesser than Blaise's) as something exploitable by his arch rival Blaise Debeste to further cement Blaise's own position in power.\n\nOn another note, Quercus Alba seems to have some notable connections to Commander Sith in terms of military rank. It\u2019s also important to note, however, that Sith\u2019s rank as Commander is higher than that of Alba\u2019s, which was a General. In other words, a Commander Sith existing in Allebahst or the Republic of Zheng Fa doesn\u2019t seem too out of the question, but given the difference in attire, it\u2019s unlikely Sith is from Allebahst, meaning Sith and Alba are more than likely opposing forces. And this mirrors the notion that the Cohdopian Smuggling Ring wasn't behind the actual presidential assassination, and the fact that we are dealing with a chess game of two competing political forces (namely, Blaise against Manfred). \n\nAs a matter of fact, there is a veiled connection between Sith and Zheng Fa, and one need look no further than Shi-Long Lang himself for this answer. Recall in AAI1-3, where upon Miles meeting Lang for the first time, Lang has a pair of X-shaped sunglasses? Well, the sash that Commander Sith has over his outfit in Ghost Trick is also X-shaped. This fact highlights a law enforcement and military connection that could arguably exist between Zheng Fa\u2019s police force and military, and it plausibly connects Commander Sith directly to the government of Zheng Fa.\n\nIn other words, if such a connection exists between Sith and the Zheng Fa government, we can speculate that either Blaise\u2019s group or Manfred\u2019s group are working in conjunction with this man. But which one would make the most logical sense?\n\nWell, as I've argued before now, Manfred was likely connected to the Cohdopian Smuggling Ring, but that was primarily targeted at dismantling the current corrupt Zheng Fa government Blaise established in the first place after assassinating the nation's legitimate president. In other words, Blaise Debeste had to have the most likely connection to Sith in the attempt to form a military coup against the current President of Zheng Fa. So\u2026between both groups in Ace Attorney, who wins in the end?\n\nWell, if we assume Ace Attorney is the timeline where Yomiel never got saved (in other words, the Ray timeline), then that means Sith got the Temsik fragment from Yomiel in the end, meaning that Blaise\u2019s group is the one that\u2019s \u201cwinning\u201d over Manfred\u2019s even after AAI2 (despite Blaise getting arrested and all that).\n\nFast-forward to Apollo Justice, and considering Kristoph Gavin\u2019s position, and Gavin's black psyche locks (which could belie the fact that Gavin is working for one of these two groups), Phoenix is somehow able to setup a surprise MASON system on him with the help of the Judge (and man established to have strong ties to Manfred and Gant). In other words, Phoenix is unwittingly on the side of Blaise, and Gavin was on the side of Manfred. The reason for this is namely the fact that Blaise's side wants to make up facts as they see fit to come up with their own truths. Manfred's side, while corrupt, holds legitimate tangential connections to people like Miles Edgeworth and Franziska von Karma who do not want to distort the truth. Arguably, Blaise's side is the more evil side, while Manfred's is lesser, but even still, Blaise's side wins again in AJ if Kristoph were actually on Manfred's side.\n\nIn DD, Phoenix winds up taking down the Phantom. The Phantom was most likely Blaise\u2019s group\u2019s attempts (with the fragment Commander Sith got and likely used to create their own international spies) at trying to combat Manfred\u2019s group even further given how they lost Kristoph Gavin. However, this time, Blaise's group cuts their losses and shoots down their Phantom, giving him up essentially without any repercussions to Phoenix in DD, meaning Manfred\u2019s group gets a small victory in the war.\n\nNow in SOJ, we see Ga\u2019ran get taken down after attacking defense attorneys and spirit mediums and operating under a corrupt system of government she took by subterfuge by killing Jove Justice. Sound familiar? Blaise\u2019s group won once again initially, but then Phoenix Wright & Co. managed to secure the Khur'ainese government from Blaise and Commander Sith in the end.\n\nBut the war is still going on between Manfred's group and Blaise's. Which side will ultimately win in the end? Or is this theory too outlandish?

Hear me out. This was a joke me and one of my freinds came up with. But actually think theirs something here, a cool headcanon if nothing else.\n\nStar wars takes place \"a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away\". The only reference of an exact time in which star wars takes place is the trailer for the original film saying that it was an adventure 1 billion years in the making. Im going to be ignoring this as star wars trailers aren't really canon material, espesially since return of the jedi, revenge of the sith and rise of skywalker all claimed to be the final movies. Only to be proven wrong.\n\nSo if star wars can take place anytime in the path so long as it is \"a long long time ago\" via human understanding. And 65 million years ago certainly fits the bill. And given that mills has travelled through space for seemingly years, its not unreasonable he could have travelled to our galaxy. Before getting taken out by the asteroid belt forming around earth during the KPG mass extinction.\n\nWithin star wars their is technically no \"humans\", we just follow the most common species in the galaxy, who are visually translated into humans for our conveniance. 65 takes a simular aproach with the humans, but it makes me wonder. Since we only see \"humans\" on somaris, Perhaps this is the home planet for the species. It makes sense that humanity would have had to evolve from somewhere, and warm enviorements with large bodies of water and trees seems like the perfect place for a human-like creature to survive. \n\nAt first the blaster mill's uses being different to the ones in star wars seems like a problem. But think about it, in star wars their fighting a war. Perphaps the gun we see in 65 is actually a highly powerful stun-gun, which makes sense as I imagine they wouldn't have want to hurt the wildlife. Plus an explorer would have a drastically different firearms to bandits and soldiers. Who we primarily see with the guns.\n\nBut alas one major problem with this theory as im sure you've noticed, Adam Driver plays Kylo Ren. Enter the second part of the theory, the reason why mills is kylo's spitting image. Is because he's his great grandfather. \n\nWe only really know one thing about han solo's dad from solo a star wars story. He's a pilot just like mills. Even better is that solo was han's chosen second name since he didn't remember his father's real second name, This made me tempted to jump to the conclusion \"Mills is han's dad\". However some tie-in comic book said his name was ovan, plus the brief glimpse of him we get looks nothing like mills. But what if mill's was ovan's father, would explain why ovan would be a pilot. Living up to his father's legacy as one of two survivors of the legendary Zoic Spacecraft. Who managed to escape a planet from another galaxy ruled by monsters just before a cattaclistic asteroid hit. This also explains why ovan became an alcoholic, his father's legacy was to much. Plus if mill's is han's grandad that means the events of 65 probably took place around 40 BBY, explaining why some of the technology looks different. \n\nI have to admit, Im very proud of this theory. And haven't really been able to find anything to debunk it.

This angers the Forerunners and forces them to turn against the Precursors and wipe them out. The remains of the Old Ones would go on to become the Flood, also known as the Enslavers which will go on to become a major threat to the galaxy.\n\nThe Forerunners would eventually devolve the Alterans into modern humans while some escaped to the Pegasus Galaxy.

The Aeldari inherit the Webway and hide within it to be protected from the Flood and Halos.\n\nThe Goa\u2019uld homeworld is a Necron Tomb World that had malfunctioned allowing the ancient Goa\u2019uld hosts to enter without resistance. They would base their technology retroactively on Necron tech which is why they also have a pyramidal aesthetic. Eventually they would enslave humanity and spread them across the stars.\n\nThe Aeldari and Asgard would develop a history as both Asgardians and Elves appear in Norse mythology. The Nox may be early Aeldari Exadites as they have a vast knowledge of the Stargates and have similar stealth technology. They would eventually form an Alliance along with the Alterans and the Furlings.\n\nOnce humanity begins the Stargate program they would steadily become a force in the galaxy, learning about the path of ascension which explains the origins of psykers and also how to become Warp entities.\n\nThe Asgard would eventually die but not before leaving a computer with all of their technological knowledge which is capable of creating devices such as Replicators. This computer is the first STC.\n\nThe Ori would eventually come to the Milky Way spreading the way of Origin, showing how warp entities can be powered through belief. With all of their power eventually being directed to Adria who returned to the warp it is possible that she could be the source of what is now the Chaos Gods.\n\nHumanity would eventually be defeated by the Wraith and forced to shut down their Stargate so the Wraith could not gain access to Earth (Humanity never knew the extent of the Stargates technology such as accessing the Webway and instead only used to for quick travel).\n\nWith all of their ships destroyed space travel would eventually be rediscovered and humanity would begin spreading through the stars until they encounter the Covenant and Forerunner technology. This technology would eventually be integrated into their own with the UNSC Infinity and the Spartan project would become the basis which would eventually give rise to the Thunder Warriors.\n\nEventually the Created, lead by Cortana who history will remember as the Men of Iron will rebel and devastate UNSC and humanity.\n\nThe Birth of Slaanesh at the hands of the Aeldari will make Slipspace (Warp Travel) impossible bringing the galaxy into the age of strife which will eventually lead the Emperor\u2019s Great Crusade and the 40k setting.\n\nIn the Pegasus galaxy, Michael created giant insects as part of his project to create Wraith hybrids on the planet Taranis.

In th3 Gravity Drive Room there is Coolant floating in spherical blobs. When Mr Justin enters the portal a strong pulse of energy sends the coolant careening in different directions and down the hallway. The coolant looks nearly identical to the souls escaping Leviathan at the end of Hellraiser 2. \n\nEvent Horizon was pitched as a Haunted House movie in space. And as such they were able to emulate a lot of the atmosphere you'd expect in a haunted house movie. The ship being next to Neptune causes eerie blue light to fall in from the windows. Lightning and thunder is present. And the Possessed ship is able to open and close its own doors at will. These are similar to Hellraiser. Whenever the box is opened, supernatural Blue light creeps into the windows. But more than that, the Cotton Household is also seemingly possessed by supernatural forces. The doors in the house also open and close at will. And although lightning isn't a motif in the first Hellraiser, inside the Labyrinth supernatural lightning can be seen deep within the maze like structures. (On a more minor note, both the Cotton house, as well as the space ships have a lot of prominent Square patterns)\n\nTo add to that, Electrical manipulation is present of both movies. When Dr Weir is in the computer crawlspace, the lights begin to go out, that's part of the ship tho so that's not that interesting. But his flashlight, which has an independent power source, also goes out. The Cenobites also have power over electrical currents. Being manifestations of Pain and Pleasure, pulsating lights signal their arrival. Television sets go static. When they appear, they form from electricity itself. \n\n(I'd also like to note that the computer crawlspace that Weir is in reminds me of the Hellraiser: Hellworld poster, though this is just a coincidence as that movie came out years after Event Horizon) \n\nIn the opening of Hellraiser 2, Elliot Spencer opens the puzzle box. He is in the bunker like building with curved walls and ceiling. The lights dim before he's torn into by hooks. He screams and there's a fast zoom in on his mouth which fades into a hallway within the Labyrinth. In Event Horizon, Miller and Weir are arguing in a hallway that's shaped very similar to the bunker in Hellraiser. The lights dim in a similar way. Later in the movie, the Cenobite version of Weir screams. There's a nearly identical zoom in on his mouth and fade the the hallway. \n\nWeir says to Miller at one point \"You wanted to know where the ship has been, now you'll find out\" it reminds me of Julia saying \"and you wanted to know, now you know\" Weir is also sucked out a window similar to how Julia is sucked down a hallway. \n\nLastly, and I can't believe I didn't include this in my original post, but DJ is killed with surgical tools much like the ones the cenobites have, and he's strung up by hooks, in one of the goriest parts of the movie. Can't believe I forgot about that in my other post. \n\nObviously none of these are very strong argument to support the idea that they are in the same universe, this is more of a complimentary post highlighting similarities I found in the movies.

In fact, it\u2019s inconceivable to me that they take orders from humans at all. I\u2019m genuinely surprised that they haven\u2019t taken over the world by now. Let\u2019s take a look at their capabilities. \n\nSeemingly invincible. Everyone talks about how hard the Patronus charm is. And how it\u2019s the only defense against dementors. If stunning them was an option, I\u2019m sure people would do it. If throwing fireballs at them caused harm, I\u2019m sure people would do it. But seemingly, the only defense is an exceptionally difficult piece of magic which not even everyone can perform. It doesn\u2019t even harm them, just forces them out of the area. \n\nIntelligent. Enough so to follow verbal commands, perform complex tasks without direct supervision, etc. if that\u2019s not human level intelligence, it\u2019s very close. Certainly I\u2019d say they\u2019re sentient, based on the behaviors they\u2019ve displayed. I believe they have more than sufficient mental capacity to organize a direct opposition to human civilization \n\nBut the dementors can\u2019t just take over, right?\n\nWrong. How exactly would they be stopped?\n\nEven if every magic user can perform a successful patronus charm, they\u2019re still a danger. As it\u2019s been stated, it\u2019s difficult to cast a patronus against multiple dementors due to the cumulative effect of their presence. So even a powerful wizard or witch could be brought down if they focused sufficient weight of numbers against them. \n\nAnd that\u2019s just assuming that the dementors fight fair. What if they cheat?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing to stop one from sneaking up on you (holding its breath so it doesn\u2019t give itself away), rushing into close range, and snatching your wand out of your hand. Good luck casting a patronus now, genius. \n\nCan a dementors operate wands? Perhaps not. But I\u2019m certain they could operate a gun or a knife or a crowbar. If they\u2019re not one hundred percent determined to avoid wasting their food, they could just start using lethal force against key leaders of the opposition, or anyone who can cast a patronus well. Regardless, the only thing more terrifying than a hungry dementor, is a hungry dementor with a Glock .40. Try casting a patronus with a hole in your leg, idiot. Plus they could use tools and equipment to break down doors and walls, if you were a clever wanker and tried to build a bunker. \n\nI\u2019m having amusing and terrifying images of a dementor driving a bulldozer now. \n\nQuite honestly, I\u2019m shocked nobody\u2019s cashed in on the inevitable Harry Potter horror spinoff of Dementorpocalypse, with besieged communities of survivors struggling to retain their souls in a nightmarish world. With dementors thralling Muggle leaders, getting them to fire off ICBMs to create a nuclear winter, and eliminate those pesky tropical climates, reduce overall sunlight, and terraform the world more toward their ideal environment. \n\nYeah, I\u2019m rambling.

I mean surely it's advanced for teenagers, pretty sure Lupin remarks that it's above a NEWT. But I would assume the most basic rank of auror must be able to cast a Patronus. And even then we have evidence that Harry was able to teach it to a bunch of other non-OP teenagers during his fifth year.\n\nNot to mention that with the Patronus a single wizard can fend off dozens if not hundreds of dementos at a time. Assuming no foul play I would imagine that all of the Azkaban perimeter is guarded by two or three wizards at any time that would bully any number of dementos that tried to leave back into Azkaban.\n\nAnd from the dementor's POV, they can either stay at Azkaban obeying the wizards and taking advantage that wizards do not respect the Geneva Convention or UN Convention Against Torture and feed from their prisoners. Or they can try leaving and fighting the wizards of which a handful (maybe even a handful of little children) can bully them all into submission again.\n\nAlso, I think you are overestimating the dementor's intelligence with them sneaking up on wizards and stealing their wands. We know they can comunicate a little bit with humans (or wizards) but they clearly show a pretty animalistic behaviour generally, a Dementor might not be much smarter than a chimpanzee or a crow which are of course intelligent when compared to an animal but will not outsmart a wizard (specially not a wizard that is aware of them and knows to cast a Patronus).\n\nAlso it's unlikely a dementor will sneak a savvy wizard, they suck up the light of the environment and create a sudden feeling of coldness, any wizard that knows about dementors and to cast a Patronus will recognize the situation quickly and prepare to cast a Patronus.\n\nDementors can of course gang up and kill less advanced wizards, but they won't take over the world since that would mean they also have to fight the wizards that can force them into mass submission.

If truly in a bind they\u2019d be using that spell with great frequency. It could even be done as an area-wide effect to drive the dementors away.

If it's special because it's a family heirloom, why does he pass over both of his actual children to give it to his stepdaughter of peasant birth?\n\nWhy did he even marry a peasant woman at all? Why was he mingling among the peasants to meet and fall in love with her? Intrinsic to monarchy is the idea that certain bloodlines are inherently superior to others. Without that claim, he's just a military dictator. By mingling his bloodline with that of a woman who's not of noble birth, he may actually be risking the perceived legitimacy of his entire reign.\n\nBut maybe, he secretly knew about the amulet's magic, but didn't want to draw too much attention to it. He knew that only a peasant girl could use it properly. According to Machiavelli, to know the mountain, you must look from the valley. Sofia has grown up poor, and now become rich, giving her a view of both the mountain and the valley, giving her a more objective view of how the country should be run. How people should interact with each other.\n\nThink about all the moral lessons that the amulet teaches Sofia. If those lessons are supposed to be intrinsic to a \"real princess\", why don't any of the girls who were born royal know how to not be jerks at the beginning, especially when they're older than her? Maybe because being a real princess isn't about lineage after all, but King Roland can't say that quiet bit out loud, because acknowledging leadership quality doesn't come from lineage would once again invalidate his rule. Therefore, he strategically planned is second marriage to bring a poor girl into the royal dynamic, so she could teach these moral lessons to the other royals.\n\nHere's another factor: Cedric's desire for power. He is the most powerful sorceror in the kingdom in a world where elementary schoolers are taught to turn a rock into a ruby, something that could already crumble an empire by turning their stone defenses into a brittle gem. And what is Cedric capable of? Not taking a necklace from an 8-year-old, apparently. Could it be that she's too cute? Or maybe it's because of the risk. Cedric is already in a pretty high position as the king's official sorceror. He has full access to the castle and the king's family. He's likely wealthy and well-respected for his position.Cedric knows he's prone to magical mishaps, and any attempt on the life of the king or his family in his pursuit of power jeopardizes what he already has, while also having a good chance of not getting him the power he was seeking. The king may already know about Cedric's plans, but knows that if Cedric is openly treated as a criminal, he'll be backed into a corner and start using magic to protect himself, and that would put everyone more in danger than if he simply keeps his enemy close and lets his stepdaughter gradually melt his heart, just like how she was able to reform Lucinda the Witch, albeit while wearing a potential WMD around her neck.\n\nEdit: we're also led to view amber as spoiled, but James is what a spoiled kid looks like, doing whatever and facing little consequence because he's the prince.

At the time of teen titans airing, both justice league unlimited and The batman (2004) were airing too.          \nThese 3 shows were not allowed to use each other\u2019s characters. For example no major batman character other than batman himself (and very minor villains like clock king), were allowed to make an appearance in justice league unlimited due to the batman (2004). This is the reason why no batman villains were shown to be members of the legion of doom. Likewise this rule resulted in a birds of prey episode featuring Barbara Gordon being scrapped as well.          \nThe same also applied for teen titans. No teen titans character was allowed in JLU or the batman 2004 and likewise no character being used in those shows was allowed in teen titan. This is why nightwing and Robin never appear in JLU (other than a very brief silhouette of nightwing in one episode). Likewise it\u2019s why the batman didn\u2019t use robin until season 4 (as by season 4 teen titans had been cancelled).

This was originally part of an integrated toy line, which means the rights to most of the characters are complicated, and likely not something Marvel wants to complicate their lives dealing with.  The one character that has made the jump from the Microverse to regular Marvel continuity is [Bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_(comics)), who became one of the Guardians of the Galaxy.  The MCU seems to have combined him with Mantis, giving her a bug-like (and Bug-like) appearance, and giving her his powers.  This shows that Marvel is interested in mining the comic Microverse for content without having to pay anyone for rights to the material, and I believe they're setting up the Micronauts, albeit under a different name.\n\nFirst, we have the existence of the Microverse itself.  In the comics, the Quantum Realm and the Microverse are two different planes of existence.  To get around using the name \"Microverse,\" the MCU has rolled them into one and used the term \"Quantum Realm,\" but other than its skies, it looks and works a lot more like the Microverse.  Beyond its appearance, they also seem to have picked up the whole background to the Microverse, replacing Baron Karza, a villainous despot who rules the Microverse with a sophisticated suit of powered armour, with Kang, a villainous despot who rules the Quantum Realm with a sophisticated suit of powered armour.\n\nNext, we have the Micronauts themselves.  In the comics, they are a diverse team made of up of heroes whose people have been crushed by Karza, and who are seeking revenge by overthrowing Karza's tyrannical rule.  We have not only seen a group which fits this bill in Quantumania, they went out of their way to build their characters and show them in action.  What's particularly interesting is the big, goofy-looking biological space ships they use in Quantumania which bear a suspicious resemblance to something called Phobos robots in the Micronauts, which were giant armed robots the Micronauts often battled.\n\nWith the underperforming of Quantumania at the box office it's possible Marvel is rethinking their plans, but I believe their original plan was to create a new team based on the Micronauts without using that name or the specific characters, probably for a TV miniseries.", "id": "136kfxm", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/136kfxm/mcu_quantumania_the_micronauts_are_coming_probably/", "created_utc": 1683120204.0, "score": 8, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/136kfxm/mcu_quantumania_the_micronauts_are_coming_probably/", "comments": ["I think QM was clearly a set-up for the heroes of the Quantumrealm, be it the \"Micronauts\" or \"Quantumnauts\" or whatever else.

So since human history in the MCU stayed roughly unchanged on the grand scale until the events of Iron Man 1, I'm going to take it for granted that presidents 1-43 were the same as the real world. So the question is, who in the MCU won the election of 2008?\n\nCandidate 1: Barrack Obama. (Democrat)\nObama, the winner of the election in our timeline, jumps to mind immediately. While Obama is referenced as the president in multiple marvel TV shows, the canonicity of them is dubious at best, so they shall not be counted.\n\nWe know Obama definitely existed ans ran for president for 2008, we just don't know if he won. In Iron man 2, Tony has a poster of himself based of the Obama campaign's \"hope\" poster in his mansion. But as this poster was created on January 22nd 2008, that means we don't know if he won the primaries as the DNC is in August.\n\nThe best piece of evidence we have that Obama was president was the appearence of the 2012 biography \"Barack Obama: The Story\" by David Maraniss. Now, is it completely possible for Maraniss to write an autobiography with the exact same title/cover even if Obama was just a senator/presidential candidate instead of a president? Yes, however I believe it seems unlikely.\n\n\n\nCandidate 2: Mathew Ellis (Party unknown)\n\nEllis is a fictional president who appeared in several movies and shows aired from 2013-2016 as president of the US. While this timeline seems to line up with winning the 2012 election, allowing Obama to win 2008 without any contradictions, issues still arise. While the Ellis's first appearance (Iron Man 3) was a movie released in 2013, it takes place in 2012. We know this as the flashback in Christmas 1999 is said to have been 13 years before the events of the movie. This means that Ellis had to have been in office in December of 2012, meaning he either won 2008, or rose up the presidential line of succession for whatever reason.\n\n\n\nIn order resolve this discrepancy between Obama's 2012 biography and Ellis being president that very same year, I propose the following timeline.\n\nNovember 2008: Obama wins the presidency.\n\nMay 2012: The battle of New York occurs. During which a nuclear missile is launched at New York City and only avoided destroying the city by Iron Man redirecting it into the sky portal. We know this was public knowledge as Rogers: The musical contains the lyrics \"Tony you've got nukes to catch be careful not to crash.\" \n\nWhile this was ordered by the World Security Council, and not the United States armed forces, it's assumed that the commander in chief of the most powerful military on earth would have some say whether nuclear weapons are launched in its own territory. Given the fact that was not considered an act of war, I assume Obama gave the go ahead at an emergency meeting in Washington.\n\nJune 19th 2012: Obama's biography releases.\n\nFall 2012: The controversy around almost nuking New York gets Obama impeached. His vice president (Ellis) is sworn into office.\n\nDecember 2012: Iron man 3 happens.\n\nThis timeline would accommodate for all discrepancies to my knowledge and would explain one additional plot point in iron man 3. Vice President Rodriguez turns out to be in the pocket of AIM and betrays Ellis. This would make more sense if Ellis picked him a few months ago on the basis of him being someone popular enough to be approved by both houses of Congress, rather than if he had hand picked him as his running mate and worked with him for the past 4 years.\n\nFrom there we know  Ellis definitely won the 2012 election, and potentially the 2016 one as he would have served less than 2 years of Obama's term. The only question now, is if he won the 2016 one. His last official appearence in an official marvel studios project was the WHiH newsfront episode regarding the events of Civil War, which takes place in June 2016, before the election. Just like Obama, things get speculative here.\n\nWhile there is no direct appearence of Ellis after 2016, there is someone from his cabinet who appears later. Thaddeus Ross who was Ellis's secretary of state, remained the secretary in infinity war which takes place in April of 2018. While cabinet members can stick around between presidencies, this is not common and has not been seen in the Secretary of state for over 100 years. Ellis is still most likely president at the time of probably the biggest headache in this whole post...\n\n\n\n**THE SNAP**\n\nUntil we have direct confirmation from marvel one way or another, it is impossible to know whether Ellis survived the snap of not. It is a coin flip no matter how much speculation I do. Either way, I do speculate that Ellis or his replacement will be out by 2021. Ellis couldn't run again anyway, and even if he was replaced by his VP who could run, the administration would be extremely unpopular no matter what.\n\nThe snap would be like COVID times 1000. No matter how well or poorly the administration handles the situation, it's impossible to come out of it with high approval ratings with this dire of a situation. Likely someone of the opposing party would win. And given that I proposed earlier that Ellis was Obama's VP, it would likely that he and his VP were both democrats. This means a republican candidate wins 2020, whose.administration would in turn have a similar crisis on its shoulders when the blip happens. \n\nAs Ross was shown to have been snapped in endgame, and is confirmed to be president by the time of CA:NWO, we know he must have won 2024 as his first term. Given the fact that he disrupted an incumbent republican president, and was selected by a Democratic president for secretary of state, it's reasonable to assume he ran as a Democrat.\n\n~~TL;DR~~\n~~My proposed timeline of MCU president.~~ (outdated)\n\nPresident 44: Barack Obama, \nPolitical party: Democrat \n(2009-2012)\nImpeached in 2012 over battle of New york\n\nPresident 45 Matthew Ellis \nPolitical party: unknown (Likely Democrat)\n(2012-2018, or 2012-2020)\nObama's former VP, could have possibly gotten snapped.\n\nPresident 46: Ellis's VP\nPolitical party (Likely Democrat)\n(2018-2021)\nScapegoated for poor management of the snap crisis.\n\nPresident 46 or 47: Unknown\nPolitical party (Likely Republican)\n(2021-2025)\nScapegoated for poor management of the blip crisis.\n\nPresident 47 or 48: Thaddeus Ross\nPolitical party (Likely Democrat)\n(2025-)\nCurrent president, founded the thunderbolts.\n\nEdit: It has come to my attention that a [President Ritson](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Ritson) was mentioned in Wakanda Forever and is to be featured in secret invasion.

Given the historical context, I'm going to give my guess as to what the plot of the movie will be, as well as who the unrevealed roles will be for the cast.\n\nSo, from my understanding we have two confirmed new roles cast: Paul Mescal as Lucius (Lucius was the kid from the first one, Commodus' nephew), and Joseph Quinn (Eddie from Stranger Things) as Emperor Caracalla. From here we can nail down the timeline, and the movie will take place anywhere between 198 to 217 AD, Caracalla's reign. For context, the original Gladiator played very fast and loose with time, but we know it began in 180 AD. In real life, Commodus reigned as Emperor for 12 years, but we know that Gladiator takes place over a period of no more than a year, as the big Gladiatorial games are staged for 150 days following the death of Marcus Aurelius. So, we're diverging from the timeline here a bit, but Commodus' reign would have ended in 180-181 AD in the Gladiator Timeline, as opposed to 177-192 AD in our timeline. I'm going to refer to this shortening of history as \"Gladiator Time\" from here on.\n\nWe also have another role that has been cast, but only a rumour as to who they are playing: Barry Keoghan as Emperor Geta. Historically, Geta was Caracalla's brother, and they both ruled together as co-emperor from 209-211 AD. I think if this is true, it narrows the start of the movie down to around this time. My guess is 211 AD, but I'll get to that later.\n\nAlso to discuss later, are the two biggest names coming in here, both of which have not been given a role yet: Denzel Washington and Pedro Pascal.\n\nWe have two cast members returning from the original, Djimon Hounsou (Juba) and Connie Nielsen (Lucilla). Juba was a fictional character, but Lucilla was a real person. We're breaking from the timeline here again, as, in real life, Lucilla was executed quite early in Commodus' reign. Additionally, Lucius (the boy) claims to be the son of Lucius Varus (Lucilla's dead husband), but Lucius Varus had no surviving male children who lived to adulthood. Lucilla did have one son that lived from her second marriage to Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus, and he and their son outlived her. Her surviving son was named Aurelius Pomeianus, and his story comes in a bit later. (I know, I'm really building the suspense here...)\n\nI think that they\u2019ll begin with Lucilla already being dead, or dying very early in the story. Her role likely will be expanded with some dreams or flashbacks, but it\u2019ll be a minor role I\u2019m guessing.\n\nSo, who were the Emperors Caracalla and Geta? They were both the sons of Septimus Severus, who came to power at the end of the Year of the Five Emperors in 193, a year of civil war following Emperor Commodus' death. Septimus Severus declared that his elder son, Caracalla, was to be his co-emperor in 198 AD, and then near the end of his reign named his younger son, Geta, to be elevated alongside his brother upon Severus' death. This occurred in 209 AD, and Geta became the junior emperor of the Roman Empire.\n\nSo why 211 AD? Because Caracalla and Geta hated each other. They both refused to share servants, and would never be in each others' presence without their mother to mediate. They officially designated separate wings of the imperial palace to belong to one another, and never crossed the line into each others' wing. As is common in the Roman Empire around this time, someone had to betray someone else. Geta attempted to assassinate Caracalla, and failed, so Caracalla called a peace meeting to be at their mother's home. When Geta arrived, Caracalla called his Praetorian guard and murdered his brother in their mother's arms. From then on, he was the sole emperor.\n\nThis is a perfect time to begin the movie, with this setup, and it mirrors the original nicely. There's another good reason to begin in 211 AD: Aurelius Pompeianus, Lucilla's real life surviving son, had become a prominent senator and politician, and was briefly a Consul of Rome, the highest office below the Caesars and Emperors. Immediately after assassinating Geta, Caracalla also had him executed, but framed the murder as an attack by bandits. I believe they're going to give Lucius this historical role. It would fit somewhat with the ending of the original Gladiator, with him joining the senate as a respected member and leader, but not taking the title of emperor.\n\nSo, let\u2019s recap here. My prediction is that the movie begins somewhere around 211 AD, and the moment that sets the plot in motion is the assassination of Geta, followed by the execution of Lucius (Aurelius Pompeianus in real life, Lucius here) in what is staged as a robbery of some sort. That means that, if I\u2019m right, the much beloved Joseph Quinn is going to be the main villain of the movie, as it will be set up as a revenge tale against Caracalla.\n\nHistorically, Caracalla, once sole emperor, was pretty awful. He was a militant tyrant, and in modern scholarship is considered one of the most tyrannical emperors in Roman history. This is our big bad here. I imagine the plot will have some sort of escape from Rome segment, where our heroes run away in the aftermath of these murders, and during this time we\u2019ll get some scenes of Caracalla being generally evil, favouring the army above all else. He might make some references to Alexander the Great, whom he greatly admired and sought to emulate in real life. He even went so far as to travel to Alexandria and persecuted the scholars of the school of Aristotle, based on the historical rumour that Aristotle had somehow poisoned Alexander the Great.\n\nI also have another prediction to make: The movie will end in 217 AD. The first Gladiator ran from the death of one emperor to the death of the next, and I think this one will do the same. However, I think they\u2019ll use Gladiator Time to get there, and the movie will span a much shorter frame of time than 6 years.\n\nSo, what happened in 217 AD? And what does Pedro Pascal have to do with this movie? Well, much like the first movie invented a historical character, Maximus, who was based loosely on several real figures, I think they\u2019ll invent one for Pedro Pascal as well. I think he\u2019ll actually be the titular Gladiator of the movie, and I\u2019m imagining that perhaps he has some sort of tie to Lucius. Perhaps Lucius freed him, and he became a bodyguard. Failing to save his master\u2019s life sets him up to take revenge on Caracalla. That\u2019s part one of his compound character.\n\nPart two is a historical figure who we know very little about, Justin Martialis. Martialis was a soldier who wanted to become a Centurion, and when he was turned down for the role by Caracalla himself, Martialis waited for Caracalla to step off the campaign trail to urinate on a tree, and he killed the emperor. Immediately after assassinating Caracalla, Martialis was killed. This would again call back to the original, with our main hero dying at the end.\n\nWas Martialis just someone with a chip on his shoulder? Was he a lone wolf? Well, no, he wasn\u2019t. He was, in fact, encouraged to kill the emperor by another prominent Roman, Macrinus. Why did Macrinus want to kill Caracalla? Well, a prophecy was earlier declared to Caracalla that Macrinus would actually betray him and become the next Emperor of Rome. As a result, Caracalla set plans in motion to assassinate Macrinus, but Macrinus got to Justin Martialis first and saved his own life in the process.\n\nMacrinus did indeed become the next emperor. The prophecy was fulfilled because of Caracalla\u2019s own actions, which just feels like it was written for a movie. This will be the climax of the movie, as Macrinus sets up the assassination of the emperor, and we will end with him being crowned in 217 AD.\n\nNow, we haven\u2019t mentioned Denzel Washington yet. Well, if I\u2019m right so far, then I know exactly who he is playing. Macrinus was the first Roman emperor from North Africa. He also was the first Roman Emperor to never visit Rome, before or during his reign. His family had Berber origins, and so, while they likely weren\u2019t black but rather North African, Denzel will fit the bill just fine, and become the first African emperor of Rome.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nPedro Pascal plays Martialis (They\u2019ll probably give him a different name, but I\u2019m going with this for now), a former gladiator who has been employed by Lucius as a bodyguard during the reign of Caracalla and Geta. Geta is assassinated and right afterwards, Lucius is killed during a framed mugging attempt as Caracalla seeks to eliminate any enemies and powerful rivals he may have, consolidating power. Martialis flees, likely with the help of Juba, former companion of Maximus, who tells him Maximus\u2019 story, and this inspires him to plan the assassination of Caracalla.\n\nMartialis and Juba head off to Spain, Martialis\u2019 homeland and he returns to fighting in the arena to train, make money, and gain allies for his plot (also because the movie is called Gladiator, so there better be some arena fighting). He revives the name \u201cThe Spaniard\u201d, Maximus\u2019 old fighting name. Meanwhile, in Rome, Caracalla becomes unhinged and starts committing atrocities and doing generically evil stuff to make sure we hate him.  He'll claim to be the reincarnation of Alexander the Great, echoing Commodus' claims of being a god in the original.  Somewhere in here, Caracalla hears the prophecy that Macrinus will succeed him, and begins plotting his death.\n\nMacrinus and Martialis meet somewhere around here and begin to plan the death of Caracalla. We\u2019ll also likely get some talk around here about honour, and how Martialis is honour-bound to avenge Lucius (because Hollywood doesn\u2019t know the difference between Ronin and Roman, so there\u2019ll be some kind of Japanese morality about avenging one\u2019s master). I\u2019m not sure where it\u2019ll lead to here, but I\u2019m betting the movie ends with Martialis running a suicide mission to kill Caracalla, where he dies at the end knowing he\u2019s fulfilled his duty and is dying with honour. And then Macrinus is crowned Emperor.\n\nSo that's my theory.  I may be totally and completely off, and I probably am.

His mother Sarah Connor was a virgin before Kyle Reese, a soldier of John from the future impregnated her after the two fell in love, leading to the birth of John Connor. In which case, Reese would be compared to an angel sent by god to deliver humanity\u2019s messiah to a virgin woman, in the Bible would be Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus. \n\n3. Kyle Reese died protecting Sarah from the Terminator, thus ensuring John Connor\u2019s existence and the salvation of mankind.

And tiny \u201cbugs\u201d?\nD) why are there kids? And why do cars die at all?\nE) why do the cars have doors?\nF) why do cars seem to have memories of actual historic events from mankind?\n\nI think this theory explains all of these.\nThe cars/planes/trains are all human beings, who have had their sentience transferred into a machine. Most of us would consider these people a little odd, who have way too much money and elect to have their bodies frozen in cryo until a time when they can be reanimated or transferred into AI. Well, imagine that technology becomes a reality. Something along the lines of the Matrix mixed with Surrogates. \n\nFirst the companies that make sentience transfer a reality start by testing on animals (bugs, cows, deer) to see if the technology is feasible (Bullet C). But they quickly realize the machine needs its source close by. So the body responsible for the brain of the machine is INSIDE the machine. (Bullet E) This explains the reasoning that cars can die. Their human inside the car eventually does die, and the car goes with it. Several times the cars talk about the taste of different fuels - perhaps the fuel they put in their mouths is actually blended human food, and the fuel that goes in their tank is gasoline. \n\nThis also makes sense when thinking about kids. If the cars were really thinking, they would never create child-cars. Do they grow? Move into a larger size model? YES! Because there are real human children inside of them. The ultra rich could afford to cryo-save their children (ie. a sick child who they wanted to preserve for the future to have a better life). So as the child grows, their body is literally moved into larger model vehicles. And it makes sense why the cars have memories of being kids as cars. They were. Their parents (real humans) got out of the cars and made real babies, which after birth were put into a car. (Bullet D)\n\nSo all these people that have been stored in cryo still have memories from our current times (Bullet F) and they come from places all over the world (Bullet B). So, as humanity is dying and people realize \u201chey, I want to be saved and turned into a machine\u201d many of the wealthy are able to afford this luxury. But some scientist had a great idea that, in a world full of cars, we\u2019re going to need a lot of services for them. So those mega cryo companies offer the opportunity to be saved to regular people - FOR FREE - on the condition that you are a mechanic and you become one of the forklifts. (Bullet A). Not strictly limited to mechanics, but essentially the indentured servant forklifts are just that, regular people who become servants for the opportunity to be saved from humanity\u2019s destruction and become a machine. \n\nI imagine something like becoming a train would have been a group purchase (a whole family contributes to the cost of saving one person) and being a plane or boat was for those with special skills (maybe these companies made a special point to save military or transportation related fields to serve the car- overlords).", "id": "1356f32", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1356f32/cars_and_planes_sentience_transfer/", "created_utc": 1682987868.0, "score": 12, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/1356f32/cars_and_planes_sentience_transfer/", "comments": ["Simpler theory: the *Cars* franchise takes place in the same universe as *Maximum Overdrive*, but far enough in the *MO* future that the sentient machines have forgotten their original creators on a conscious level.

The crashed humans lost or messed up their previous knowledge, leading humans to develop. One day, the space people come back, give out knowledge to aid Earth, and leave to their own colonies. We made a lot of space stations and Mars progress real fast, while some people protected themselves from the inevitable Quiet Rapture. They hid a lot of info, and Eden was sick of it, so they attacked a station. They didn't like that, pretty much enslaved the survivors, and sent them trying to find knowledge on previous human colonies to save themselves from losing all their resources and dying out. The moon they chose to look into was AT-5, where they sent the Player to try and figure out shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDetailed version:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHumanity was once a vast-spreading species, similar to Star Wars, but one particular day, a vessel crashed on Earth. We eventually forgot knowledge previously acquired, and that got misconstrued into religions (the Quiet Rapture was theorized to be a literal, religious rapture by some according to the , so we could've had this knowledge before the crash on Earth).\n\nOther humans throughout the galaxy, possibly the universe, were made aware of the failure a long time after it occurred, and seeked out humans eventually. They would consult government organizations with new technologies, allowing them to speed up space colonization, while also not being too suspicious in how much technology came instantly, in which they did, setting up the first Mars station in 1992 AD, and creating the colonization of Eden.\n\nAs the public grew aware of the wreckage of Earth, they left to both Mars and various space stations. Long after, the Quiet Rapture occurs, destroying all habitable planets/stars, therefore wiping the foreign humans out, along with their own colonies (with the possibility of some unknown survivors). The leaders enlightened to the knowledge presented to them by our long gone ancestors led some of Eden to stay in different space stations with some supplies in preperation for the Quiet Rapture.\n\nShortly after, the enlightened humans in those space stations formed the Consolidation of Iron, or COI for short, leading their own lives in search for something to save them. The COI were the last humans with the knowledge, but Eden did not like how much knowledge they hid from the common people. This led to the Attack of the Filament Station, and it... somewhat worked, destroying the COI's biggest station, but some of Eden was also taken hostage for \"conviction realization\".\n\nThis leads to the game, one of the convicts, presumably from Eden and the attack, is sent to explore the blood ocean AT-5, the COI hoping to kill off another Eden traitor, and gain more knowledge to help them in the previous human colony after their own research vessel, the SM-8 was attacked. This leads to the playable character discovering alien entities alongside human structures in the same ocean, swimming in a bath of a large population's blood\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExtra shit:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason I believe the COI has most of the knowledge they do is because of possible foreign humans, the reason why we went to Mars in '92, rather than like us in the real world only sending rovers to the planet. The foreign human theory also explains why the oceans were human blood, rather than something unknown to us. They also like to redact info... a LOT of info, so much it's disturbing, mainly regarding the knowledge of AT-5, nonetheless ***life*** on moon.\n\nThe structures being similar to Earth is also a key feature, as we established homes and stations on moons and planets seperate from the blood moons. I would believe they are other human stations, seperate from the idea that we are the aliens, but the COI would have known of other human stations disappearing, unless they are trying to recollect their knowledge given by the foreign humans, and just discovered it was a station of theirs.\n\nAs for the main threat to you, the monster, it might be a twisted mutation of some form of wildlife native to the moon, growing so large it can wreck sea vessels with ease. It has clearly dominated other large, possibly mutated species given all the skeletons, and the vessels they keep sending it seem to be feeding it. The mutations may have been caused by literal ***blood*** tampering the standard water (also why the blood remains liquid), infecting it and causing something to alter its mind and body to make it stronger and more hostile\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone's read this much, thank you, it was fun to try and piece together", "id": "1352rmf", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1352rmf/iron_lung_humanity_was_alien_to_earth_and_the/", "created_utc": 1682978655.0, "score": 43, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/1352rmf/iron_lung_humanity_was_alien_to_earth_and_the/", "comments": ["I read this as Iron Man and was lost for the last 5 minutes.", "I like this a lot!!

It's established by Tanner himself that he has problems committing sheet music to memory. If his grand plan was to get Andrew into trouble, then feigning that the folder was missing would only mean Tanner risks his own position in the band by being unable to play Whiplash in the competition. What was his plan then, to turn around and say \"oh wait I found the folder it's right here\", just before going back on? There's no reason for Tanner to do so as it mainly reflects badly on him for trusting his music to someone else, as Fletcher states. In the worst case for Tanner, as we see in the movie, Andrew actually does know Whiplash by heart, and takes first chair over Tanner. Tanner had to have known that it was a possibility, especially as he has memory issues.\n\n2) In the final scene, we see a glimpse of the folder that Andrew uses, with identical markings to the supposedly stolen folder. You could make the argument that Tanner stole the folder and returned it after, but given that it was still in Fletcher's possession even after being fired, it's more logical to assume that Fletcher had it on his person and therefore he took the folder. There was sufficient time where the folder was out of sight, the camera was close up on Andrew, with his back to the folder where Fletcher could have quickly snuck in and taken it.

And had he stole it, once Andrew claims to know how to play the charts by heart, he would have no incentive not to magically find the folder, if only so that he could keep his spot. \n\nIt would be a pretty wild gamble, but I understand the theory of him wanting to put Andrew on the spot. \n\nI have to agree with some of the other comments, I truly believe it was a Fletcher mind-game directed at both drummers. It doesn't matter to Fletcher who left it on the chair, it's Tanner's responsibility to guard it. \n\nSo when he saw the folder, he decided to take it and make Tanner squirm. Maybe it was his attempt to oust him from the band for not knowing his charts. Maybe it was an attempt to see if Andrew really was the real deal. Probably both lol \n\nUpon rewatching, I believe most of Fletcher's decisions were directed towards Andrew, to see if he lived up to the potential he saw.

Please upvote the original post as well!\n\nEvery time we see a forklift in the films, it's for some menial labor job, and most of the time, it's a whole crew of forklifts working on it together. The racing pits from the first film, the food court from the second film, Pope Pinion has a few forklift altar servers following him in the second film, etc. Forklifts are always in some menial job below the other cars. Never a position of respect. They either provide a service or they're completely overlooked.\n\nAnd it's not like the jobs they fill have to be filled by forklifts, either. Some might say the forklifts are the only vehicles that can manipulate tools easily, but we are shown multiple times throughout the  films that's not the case. Many tools are built to fit over a car's lug  nuts, like the press cameras and Ramone's spray guns from the first  film, and some cars can even use their antennas for those things, like Luigi squeegeeing his windows in the first film or the Queen of England knighting Mater in the second. On top of that, the gas pumps at Flo's, the phone in McQueen's trailer, and every door or gate in the first film is shown to be easily operated by cars pressing their tires against  pedals. And the Mater's Tall Tales short \"Time Travel Mater\" shows Stanley even had a sophisticated tire-pedal-controlled device to precisely pick up a rad cap and screw it onto McQueen's radiator for him. All of these things are proof that other vehicles can easily manipulate objects just as easily, if not with more precision, than a forklift with their prongs.\n\nMaybe one advantage a forklift would have is their sheer lifting capacity. but the truth is that we don't see them in places where that strength is needed. Lifting tires with rims might be justified, but otherwise we seem them holding socket wrenches, using knives to dole out wasabi, raking sand, carrying incense burners for the Pope, and so forth. The one potential reason for specifically forklifts to be delegated to a role isn't even in effect for most of the roles they're being put into.\n\nSo if forklifts are being systematically forced out of authority positions, into menial labor jobs that other cars can easily perform, the question is why that is? My theory is that forklifts are treated that way because they are not the only heavy equipment we see. The Cars Universe also features tractors, combine harvesters, dump trucks, bulldozers (seen in *El Matordor*) and cranes (seen in *Tokyo Mater*), all of which are considered heavy equipment (which forklifts are also  classified as) and all of which are portrayed in the films as unintelligent cattle-like animals.\n\nAnti-forklift prejudice exists because forklifts are associated with vehicles that are commonly used as livestock. Perhaps at some point in the past forklifts *were* livestock (or enslaved and treated like livestock) and managed to break free of their shackles, but the stereotype of them being unintelligent work animals still remains.", "id": "134dsum", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/134dsum/cars_the_forklifts_in_the_cars_universe_are/", "created_utc": 1682919597.0, "score": 13, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/134dsum/cars_the_forklifts_in_the_cars_universe_are/", "comments": ["This is very observant, and it might be true in the universe but I don't expect any movie about Car John Brown to happen any time soon."], "URLs": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/Carsconspiracy/comments/q7vyxw/a_general_pattern_i_noticed_across_multiple_films/)"], "html_title": ["r Carsconspiracy comments a general pattern i noticed across multiple films"]},{"title": "So a couple months ago I thought of a super convoluted fan theory for the TV show Full House", "selftext": "So basically Full House is in the same universe as family matters.

This multiverse concept allows fans to enjoy each version of Bond on its own terms, without being limited by the constraints of continuity or a shared timeline.\n\nThe theory begins with Sean Connery's Bond, who existed in a universe where Cold War tensions were at their height. This universe was characterized by a sense of danger and uncertainty, with Bond's missions often pitting him against Soviet agents or other enemies of the West. Connery's portrayal of the character was rugged and focused on physical combat, with a no-nonsense attitude that reflected the seriousness of the era.\n\nRoger Moore's Bond, on the other hand, existed in a more lighthearted and humorous universe, where the character was almost a superhero capable of accomplishing seemingly impossible feats. This universe was defined by its fantastical elements, with Bond's missions taking him to exotic locations and pitting him against over-the-top villains. Moore's portrayal of the character was suave and sophisticated, with an emphasis on humor and wit that set him apart from his predecessors.\n\nTimothy Dalton's Bond existed in a darker and more serious universe, where the character's missions often had personal stakes and emotional weight. This universe was characterized by a sense of betrayal and deception, with Bond often questioning his own loyalties and motivations. Dalton's portrayal of the character was brooding and introspective, with a focus on themes of redemption and moral ambiguity.\n\nPierce Brosnan's Bond, in my theory, existed in a universe that was heavily influenced by technology and the internet. This universe was characterized by a sense of global interconnectedness, with Bond's missions often taking him to different corners of the world to confront technologically savvy enemies. Brosnan's portrayal of the character was suave and sophisticated, with an emphasis on high-tech gadgets and spy craft that reflected the changing times.\n\nFinally, Daniel Craig's Bond exists in a more grounded and realistic universe, where the character's portrayal is gritty and intense, with an emphasis on raw physicality and emotional depth. This universe is defined by its realism and authenticity, with Bond's missions often having real-world implications and consequences. Craig's portrayal of the character is rugged and vulnerable, with a focus on themes of trauma and identity that make him stand out from his predecessors.\n\nWhile some fans might view these different universes as separate and distinct, I believe that they are all part of a larger Bond multiverse, where each actor's portrayal of the character exists within its own unique reality.

I'm just going to ignore Lazenby and OHMSS because Craig did the whole family thing way better.

A Fan Theory on How Souls and Meteorites Unite the Universes", "selftext": "Okay, so this theory is going to be a long one broken up into multiple different posts, so get out some popcorn and be prepared for a wild ride (I'll post more theories that connect all of these things together and tie them all together on a separate occasion). First of all, I'm going to conclusively prove to you that Ghost Trick Phantom Detective as well as the entire Ace Attorney franchise are all interconnected regarding the true essence of souls and meteorites in both universes.\n\nObviously, there's likely going to be major spoilers for pretty much all games (I haven't played Chronicles fully yet, but I'm pretty sure that what I say here might be able to be amended for that as well, as this theory I am about to make is pretty major. It may have been posted somewhere else before all this, but to my knowledge, I'm not aware of it, so here I go).\n\nAlright, but first of all, I'd like you to take note of the exorcism of [Dahlia Hawthorne](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131g0ul/ace_attorney_the_true_essence_of_dahlia/) from Maya Fey's body in Trials & Tribulations finale, and I'd like you to note that after Dahlia's exorcism, it is revealed that she has a blue soul, akin to that of wisdom.\n\nNow, I made a fan theory about the possibility of Dahlia's innocence, but it's only that. A fan theory. In all likelihood, she may have done what she was said to have done. However, what if I told you that Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective had this exact same connection with souls like Sissel's, Missile's, and Yomiel's in their universe? What if I also told you that [Dahlia Hawthorne](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Dahlia_Hawthorne?so=search) developed spiritual powers upon death similar to Yomiel's upon jumping off of Dusky Bridge? Sure, her father was a jeweler, and Dahlia jumped off the bridge with a [$2 million diamond](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Diamond), but was this pink thing actually a diamond, or was it a moon rock? Would that be too insane to suggest, or does it actually make things about Dahlia make WAY MORE SENSE as a character, especially given how after her soul got exorcised, her spirit formed a \"blue-flamed magatama\", and how this blue flame is similar to what we have seen from Sissel in Ghost Trick? Only souls that die near Temsik radiation give off this blue flame, after all, so Dahlia might have actually gotten spiritual powers upon death, and one of the rock's fragments could have pierced her body if it wasn't actually a diamond, but rather, part of an Temsik fragment.\n\nFurthermore, let's realize that like in that universe, each soul upon death and exposure to the Temsik meteorite fragment gives the person a kind of \"radiation\", or power, upon death.\n\nAlso, let's take a deep dive into Dual Destinies's [Phantom](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom?so=search) character, and how he relates to this fact. Also, let's consider the [spiritual stones](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Magatama?so=search) used by the Fey Clan. I'm going to argue that these stones come from a similar form of the Temsik meteorite fragment that struck down in Temsik part 10 years prior to the events of Ghost Trick.\n\nFurthermore, consider that Phantom's goal in destroying the HAT-1 and HAT-2 projects. Why did an international group want him to bomb and destroy the launches? Well, that's simple. Because the Temsik meteorite fragment has the capability of giving people their spiritual powers upon their death.\n\nNow, with that in mind, consider the [Hope \"Capsule\"](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/%22Hope%22_Capsule) that the Phantom got their blood on after killing [Metis Cykes](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Metis_Cykes?so=search), or Athena Cykes's mother. Also, consider the proximity of Metis to the Hope fragments Starbuck got from HAT-1 before her death. This means that the story of Metis Cykes may not have ended there, as Metis's soul could have been capable of possessing objects like Sissel. In other words, let's consider Widget, Athena's trusty companion. What if Metis were actually [Widget](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Widget?so=search), and she was always with her daughter the whole time?\n\nAlso, consider [Athena's earring](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Moon_Rock_Earring), made from the same moon rock the Phantom sought to destroy. This means that if Athena were to die, her soul would be in connection to this moon rock, which would give her spiritual powers upon death like Metis.\n\nAlso, [Clay Terran](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Clay_Terran), Apollo's friend, also died near this moon rock as well. This means that not only Metis, but Clay Terran, could have spiritual powers in the Ace Attorney universe. What if Clay is also the dude that gave Apollo spiritual powers in his bracelet by traveling back in time with Metis just like Missile did in order to become Ray?! Is there another Ghost Trick in the works by Shu Takumi?! What do you guys think?\n\nAlso, consider the element of time travel for spirits in Ghost Trick for a second here. What if Clay or Metis found one of these souls like Yomiel's that were dead years ago, and they went back years before their death? Then they could give both Apollo and Athena, their best friend and daughter respectively, their powers that they use in the courtroom!\n\nIn addition, consider [the Phantom's](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom?so=search) death-defying leap. Why was the Phantom not afraid of jumping onto the ladder? Well, let's consider the possibility that the Phantom's actually of similar composition to Yomiel, and that if he actually fell, he could have always gotten back up. Recall how Yomiel is shot by [Cabanela](https://ghost-trick.fandom.com/wiki/Cabanela), and he gets back up? What if the Phantom was an international spy who died upon having their heart pierced by a moon rock, similar to how Yomiel died? That would be why the Phantom is not afraid of death because it straight up does not exist for him (unless, of course, the true essence of his nature were to be discovered and exploited to various ends).\n\nOr, for that matter, what if the Phantom were made by international spies in a lab? What if the Phantom was merely a puppet of the international group of spies (or the green-skinned people led by [Commander Sith](https://ghost-trick.fandom.com/wiki/Sith) in Ghost Trick). This would explain the Phantom's final words of concern when asked to reveal his true face by Phoenix, Apollo, and Athena.\n\nIn other words, the Phantom was worried about being shot by a sniper because then that would mean the end of his career, or in other words, an end to him experiencing a true death and a rebirth.\n\nYomiel was promised many things by Commander Sith, arguably the main antagonist of Ghost Trick. Sith was an old green-skinned commander who made false promises to Yomiel in order to obtain the meteorite fragment from his heart. Sith wanted Yomiel's powers all to himself upon death. And if Sith knew the truth about the fragment, other illicit people in Ace Attorney's likely shadow network knew about it as well.\n\nLet's also consider spiritual mediums and their Magatamas for a second in the Ace Attorney universe. These things allow mediums to channel dead spirits into their bodies, so they could arguably also be crafted from meteorite fragments long ago. The only requirements is for the true name and true face of the spirit to be known for their channeling to be a success. Parting Magatamas also exist for the reverse reason, meaning that different moon rocks give off different abilities upon death.\n\nThis is what primarily makes the Phantom freak out and seek to put on a constant stream of masks. So long as the meteorite fragment never leaves his body, or in other words, so long as he is not caught by the corrupt legal system, his \"safety\" is a sure thing.\n\nThis is the fear that the Phantom is primarily concerned about in Dual Destinies, which gives a whole new dimension to his takedown. Arguably, the Phantom could be one of the most tragic characters in the Ace Attorney franchise since his fate is very similar to Yomiel. We are told the Phantom simply admitted to all of his crimes upon facing intensive interrogation, but how do we know this is a sure thing if the legal system might be corrupt? Sure, Miles Edgeworth is an upstanding Chief Prosecutor, so he's unlikely to lie, but somebody else he's working for might not be so understanding regarding the method of the Phantom's interrogation, especially if they knew the true power of the [Temsik fragments](https://ghost-trick.fandom.com/wiki/Temsik_Meteorite?so=search).\n\nRecall Cabanela's interrogation of Yomiel, and let's also draw some comparisons to Neil Marshall and Damon Gant in their interrogation of Joe Darke. Both men were put under intensive pressure by external forces. Why, though? Why exactly were these men both put under similar forms of intensive interrogation?\n\nWell, if one considers the fact that Damon Gant understands the spiritual capacities tied to the Fey Clan (given his [ID number 7777777](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/ID_Card_Record) matching up with Ami Fey's [Shichishito](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Shichishito)), then the pieces all fall into place. Damon Gant knew Joe Darke's killings were a major threat to the [shadow network](https://www.reddit.com/r/AceAttorney/comments/1329m67/ace_attorney_the_redd_white_and_grossberg/) for some reason, so are we certain that a Temsik meteorite fragment was not involved in the case whatsoever?\n\nAfter all, let's entertain the possibility of a meteorite fragment crashing down into Temsik Park, and how it was buried deep within the earth. Couldn't [Temsik Park](https://ghost-trick.fandom.com/wiki/Temsik_Park) actually be [People Park](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/People_Park?so=search) in the Ace Attorney universe, the only difference being that Yomiel's death was in an alternate timeline and didn't actually happen?\n\nAlso, in case things didn't already shock you, I've got more theory bombs to drop. Namely, what if [Detective Jowd](https://ghost-trick.fandom.com/wiki/Jowd?so=search) or [Inspector Cabanela](https://ghost-trick.fandom.com/wiki/Cabanela) and Detective [Damon Gant](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Damon_Gant?so=search) were biologically related, or in fact the same exact individual? After all, their appearances are strikingly similar (similar beards and hair styles, for instance). What if [Damon Gant](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Damon_Gant?so=search) was the person Detective Jowd turned into in the ending of Ghost Trick? Also, keep in mind that Detective Jowd got struck in the leg with the Temsik fragment in the end.\n\nThis would then mean that Damon Gant could have been of a similar composition to that of the Phantom if he were shot dead as Detective Jowd in a criminal shooting years after the events of Ghost Trick, for example. This would also explain why the man was able to climb the ladder of the police force so fast, and why he was such a threat to the legal system.\n\nHell, Gant could have even had the ability to possess poor [Joe Darke](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Joe_Darke?so=search), and have Joe commit murders, all to satiate and cement Gant's position. But then Joe Darke did something not even Damon Gant could have predicted about a year later. He turned himself in for his crimes months after the incident.\n\nThat must have made Gant freak out and sweat a bit, so is it any wonder why Joe Darke got grilled in his interrogation similar to Yomiel with Cabanela? Hell, Gant might have even gone more overboard than even Cabanela, but Neil likely didn't know the full extent of Gant's deception. Gant could have even forged evidence on Joe Darke's knife used in his crimes if he really wanted to. Aren't there parallels to be drawn between Joe and Yomiel here in their respective interrogations, or am I missing something crucial here? Couldn't it also explain why Gant murdered Neil almost on a whim? What if Neil found out the truth from Joe Darke, and that's why Neil got murdered by Gant? The possibilities seem endless now.\n\nDamon Gant could also very well be Inspector Cabanela, too, and as a result was aware of the spiritual essence of the souls upon death and how they could tie into the Fey clan and be a very dangerous source of power. If Damon were Cabanela, we could also consider him to be part of a timeline where Cabanela lost Lynne, Kamila, Jowd, Missile, Sissel, and Yomiel to Commander Sith, who's running the shadow network now. In other words, Cabanela or Gant would be an unknown quantity that somebody like Sith could have also exploited given the fact that the man lost all of his friends early on in his life.\n\nI have another theory on who [Yomiel](https://ghost-trick.fandom.com/wiki/Yomiel?so=search) is similar to in terms of appearance and characterization within the Ace Attorney franchise, but I suppose that's for another theory in the future. I just thought that these facts were genuinely intriguing and almost electrifying once I had made the connections myself.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Are Ghost Trick and Ace Attorney linked together? I think Shu Takumi might have said that they were both in the same universe somewhere, but I don't think everyone is necessarily aware of how deep this rabbit hole might go, especially when one considers all of the Ace Attorney cases, and how intrinsic connections can be made to all of them in general.", "id": "13313my", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/13313my/ghost_trick_phantom_detective_ace_attorney_are/", "created_utc": 1682787962.0, "score": 40, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/13313my/ghost_trick_phantom_detective_ace_attorney_are/", "comments": ["Man, you really like ace attorney don't you", "Well, I'm mainly into the analysis of them now after playing most of them except for Chronicles (I haven't finished the full English translation of Case 4 in the first game of Chronicles, but I haven't seen or done anything regarding the second game).

Oftentimes as with many other things, when you re-watch any movie or series multiple times over and over again, we notice certain things better which may have been missed while watching it earlier.\n\nOne peculiar thing that I have been noticing and now after re watching it multiple times with that viewpoint, I am almost certain that this may as well be the show creators' easter egg or one might just term it as another fan theory.\n\nThe thing that I am referring to is that Michale Scott is an expert psychologist and \"DunderMifflin\" is a place where people with mental problems are treated by him. Imagine the Office as a modern breakthrough in the field of psychiatric where instead of sessions where patients lie down on couch and share with their doctor their problems, here the psychologist is learning about patients and teaching/treating them while pretending to work in the office.\n\nHere are some of the issues that I've imagined of the employees/ patients of the DunderMifflin.

Now, how could this be you ask. I think the bullet, traveling backwards through our time, has always been in his arm. The pain and blood he felt wasn't from the gunshot wound, since he hadn't actually been shot yet, it was from the bullet slowly working its way to the surface of his arm. His flesh isn't inverted so it will not suddenly get a hole in it, not until the inverted gun actually fires, but the inverted bullet is \"preparing\" to be entering his arm since from its point of view it was fired later.\n\nSo, he had the bullet in his arm from birth, is my theory. Wouldn't someone have seen it? No. If they had, they would have taken it out. And they couldn't have taken it out since it wouldn't have been able to be shot into him if it was taken out. When you think of the idea that inverted objects can be \"sucked\" into your hand, the bullet will have been \"sucked\" (or guided by entropy) into whatever situation it needed to be in to end up in his arm.

The film kinda explains it when Neil tells the protagonist that the forward time dominates. TP responds by saying \"like pissing in the wind\". How that applies in practice is that objects travelling backwards can get swallowed up by the dominant flow. If an inverted bullet shoots a wall that damage won't persist into the past forever. It will eventually fade. Or from a forwards perspective the bullet hole will spontaneously appear in advance of getting \"unshot\". The alternative is windows and seat with bullet holes in them being installed.\n\nInterestingly the protagonist is inverted when he experiences this.

[SPOILERS]", "selftext": "So, I've been re-watching the movie recently and I noticed a few things. It's obvious we know that something is off about King Candy, since we know he's either created a fake persona or whole sale taken the identity of an existing character. However, it was his behavior surrounding the \"taffy monster\" that was Ralph during the draft for the random roster race that got some gears turning. \n\nAfter Ralph is trapped in the cupcake and more or less subdued, King Candy orders him to be taken to the castle rather than trying to figure out what he is on the spot. That could just be caution, for concern of causing more panic. When he gets to his castle, he only allows Herschel, Duncan and Sour Bill to be in the room while he unmasks this (at present time) unknown intruder. However, he has 6 guards outside, guards who immediately come to his defense when Ralph threatens him later. Why wouldn't he have them inside in case this thing breaks free? \n\nBecause he doesn't want anyone to know who his accomplice is. Hershel and Duncan were shown to be cowards, easily swayed and frankly, idiots. Sour Bill was complicit with King Candy already, he knew more than he was letting on and moved to protect King Candy on multiple occasions even though he knew something worse was happening behind the scenes. I've seen theories on how Sour Bill helped Turbo overthrow Vanellope and I can see those as being accurate. I think King Candy kept the throne room audience sparse because he thought the other virus had come to ask for a favor, or someplace else to crash. He was genuinely surprised when Ralph was in there, and reacted violently when he thought Ralph might game jump even after he explained that he had only done so to get a medal. I think King Candy was ready to fight to protect his already stolen game. \n\nKing Candy HAD to have had contact with someone else. Where else could he have gotten the Konami code? We see him look at it on a Tappers napkin. So either Tapper or someone he met there had given it to him. So, if it WAS Tapper, why didn't he give the same information to Ralph when he went looking for a medal? Ralph could have gotten one the same way King Candy retrieved it for Ralph. It's possible he regretted sharing it with Turbo and didn't want to make the same mistake twice, but it's also just as likely that Tapper wasn't the original source. So if it wasn't him then who? \n\nDuring the final fight on Diet Cola Mountain, King Candy/Turbo says that he's \"Now the most powerful virus in the Arcade.\" and can \"Take over any game \\[he\\] wants\". Doesn't this imply that previously, he had NOT been the most powerful virus in the Arcade? And that there were games he COULDN'T take over before hand? To me, this all points to the idea that there either is or was another virus in the arcade, and Turbo met him at Tappers.   \n\n\nSo, who are our suspects? \n\nTapper - The most obvious, but maybe the least likely. It's possible he just took over the identity of tapper and destroyed the previous personality but there's not a lot of evidence to support that. \n\nGene - An easy target in this instance since the movie tries so hard to get us to not like him. I wasn't able to find any instance, other than the roof toss scene, of Gene appearing on screen during Fix-It Felix Jr's intro or gameplay. It's possible the virus found a nice big penthouse and wrote himself into a scene that already contained a bunch of other characters so he could blend in, then no one would question why he was in the game. No one would notice the addition of a new Nicelander if he locked up everyone's memories the same way Turbo did. Most of the Nicelanders are very much followers, being passive (or passive aggressive). Not Gene, he's the only one of the group (Felix and Ralph included) who seems to actively plan and have opinions. He's never liked Ralph, but particularly started hating him when he started upsetting the peaceful eco system of the game. Gene was also the last to leave the game, surprisingly chill about the whole ordeal. Maybe it was guilt, maybe he'd been through it before. \n\nThe Surge Protector - If you're a booted character from a game, looking for a place to go then you go to the surge protector. Except, you can die there. So wouldn't the most logical place to be, the place that would be the least likely to get unplugged, be the surge protector itself? Writing yourself in as a native character to the surge protector would easily go without notice to most people, it's the only one they know. I also think this is likely given how EXTREMELY BORED he is. We know he bothers Ralph, and from the credits he's at least partially responsible for the graffiti. He's immortal and powerful, and bored. \n\nThe Bug - Remember the cockroach at Tappers? The one that crawls on Ralphs shoulder and scares Markowski? What game had cockroaches? Pests don't just naturally spawn in these worlds, and they didn't show us any bugs from any screenshots we saw. No villain, not even the Zombie was crawling with bugs. What if it's a literal bug. An unfinished sprite, or untethered AI controlled bot in some game. We only know that Glitch's (in Vanellopes case) can't leave the game, but that might have even been something King Candy did and told the racers, we have no other examples of it. If Vanellope can't leave her game, she couldn't tell anyone what was happening so no one would come asking questions. So maybe it is in itself a glitch, either leaving a game because it had no place or jumping ship from an unplugged one. \n\nThere's other possibilities of course, I couldn't place an extra character in any game. Some were obviously made up for the movie, so they'd be harder to pin down. In any case, this may just be one of those things never really explained.

In the second movie, it is revealed that his father is Ego (Kurt Russell), a Celestial who turned into a living planet and tried to conquer the universe using his children as extensions of himself. Quill manages to resist Ego\u2019s control and destroy him with the help of his friends, but loses his celestial powers in the process.

Spoilers for likely all games in the series once this theory gets fully fleshed out, but those won't be posted here, so I'll keep things as related as I can to my original theory in this thread. If you proceed to that link I posted above, know you have been warned!\n\n**SPOILERS FOR AA: RFtA, T&T, DD, and SOJ**\n\nIn the world of Ace Attorney, Dual Destinies features an enigmatic primary antagonist known as the Phantom. The character's motives remain unclear, and their identity is difficult to pin down. However, I shall attempt to provide a theory, suggesting that the Phantom's true identity is that of [Ami Fey](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Ami_Fey), the founder of the Fey Clan.\n\nAmi Fey's channeling technique was inspired by the Kingdom of Khur'ain, and she took many of the Holy Mother's practices. However, at the same time, Ami Fey was named after [Amit\u0101bha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit%C4%81bha), the principal buddha in Pure Land Buddhism. Although Ami had some differences from this Buddha, given the Fey clan belief that as long as Ami Fey's continued to reside in her urn, the spiritual power of the Fey clan could continue.\n\nHowever, throughout the franchise, [Ami Fey's urn has been destroyed multiple times](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Sacred_Urn), so there is an argument that this could affect her personality in a way that differs from Amit\u0101bha. [The Phantom](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom), on another note, describes themselves as \"nothing but an endless abyss,\" which is similar to someone like Ami Fey's actualization of a \"deep awareness of emptiness\" in herself as well as those who perform the [Kurain Channeling Technique](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Kurain_Channeling_Technique).\n\nAdditionally, if Ami Fey were hypothetically spiritually summoned by someone else, she could override the consciousness of that same individual and impede their ability to get them out of their body. Evidence for this is given in regards to the summoning of the [Holy Mother](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Holy_Mother?so=search) in Spirit of Justice, where there is a claim made that whoever summons the Holy Mother would be granted immense power. But that belief could also be skewed if the Holy Mother were not a force for good, but for evil instead. Additionally, if one considers Dahlia Hawthorne was trapped in Maya Fey's body when she was weaker, and the fact that Dhurke Sahdmadhi was present in Maya's body for such a long time in Spirit of Justice, one can see that a spirit medium's lack of training can negatively impact them if they try and summon even someone with no spiritual power with connections to the Fey family like Dahlia Hawthorne. If Maya struggled so much with Dahlia, then is it hard to imagine that a weaker spiritual medium than even her would basically \"die\" if they summoned someone like Ami Fey?\n\nFor instance, if Ami Fey were summoned into the body of a spirit medium, the competing spiritual forces of the summoning spirit medium and the summoned spirit medium Ami Fey could result in Ami Fey \"taking charge\" of this particular individual. This would in turn allow Ami Fey to become a spy-like figure akin to that of [Lady Kee'ra](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Kee'ra), or even summon her if Ami Fey happened to know Lady Kee'ra's true name and face from the past. It also isn't outside the realm of possibility that these types of summoned agents could form multiple faces for themselves, hence a desire for them to wear masks to obscure their actual identities. The masks primarily serve as a means for these minor spiritual mediums to hide the fact that they could be pulling from power from a source much greater than even them.\n\nNow, the argument against Lady Kee'ra is known to be that Lady Kee'ra did not actually possess any spiritual ability like her sister, the Holy Mother did. But here's something to put into consideration for a second. If the Holy Mother has such incredible spiritual power, couldn't she have given a small bit of it to her sister to allow her to channel an even greater spirit? It's also possible that these summoned agents could form multiple identities and wear masks to hide their true identities, thereby obscuring their source of power.\n\nOne could argue that this is exactly what makes up the Phantom. Now, granted, the Phantom may not actually be Ami Fey, but there is also symbolic significance if the Phantom is based on Ami Fey, at least as far as connections to the [shadow network](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131dftt/ace_attorney_the_redd_white_and_grossberg/) are concerned. Namely, the [Shichishito](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Shichishito), a seven-branched sword from Bridge to the Turnabout, needs heavy consideration here, as Ami Fey's statue holds it. After all, the fact that the sword contains seven branches is not a coincidence, as I believe it has ties to the shadow network making up the Ace Attorney franchise in and of itself. Ami Fey's statue holds this sword, indicating that Ami Fey adheres to the ideology around this sword.\n\nThere is also actually another figure in the Ace Attorney franchise who also adheres to an ideology around seven sevens, and this figure is none other than ex-Chief of Police Detective Damon Gant. The man's ID card number is actually 7777777. That's seven sevens exactly, and if you don't believe me, you can consult the [ID Card](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/ID_Card_Record) evidence log for proof along with the [Shichishito's evidence log](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Shichishito) to confirm the equality of seven sevens. Also, if we want to go even further down the rabbit hole for a connection between Ami and Gant, we can with the theft by Ron DeLite at Lordly Tailor. The Shichishito was a piece of evidence that Atmey claimed Ron struck him in the head with, and meanwhile another crime happened at KB Security. Coincidentally, Gant's ID number is also what he used for his safe, which happened to come from [KB Security](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/KB_Security) as well. This means that Kane Bullard, Ami Fey, and Damon Gant all share some connection to seven sevens. Now, is it simply coincidence that Ami Fey's sword is in line with Damon Gant's ID number, and that Damon Gant was a force of corruption within the Ace Attorney universe? This connection raises questions about the sinister motivations of the shadow network within the Ace Attorney franchise and whether Ami Fey's clan could be instrumental in achieving their goals.\n\nWhile we're also talking about seven sevens, here, I have a quote from Pearl Fey that proves interesting regarding the Kurain Channeling Technique as it was passed down: \"There are **six lines** to the Sacred Writings. Cleanse thy soul... Open the door to the spiritual realm beyond... Converse with the departed... ...Cast on thyself Protection... Maintain the spell... Release the spell...\" However, what is curious here is why there isn't a notion of seven here. Could there be a hidden seventh step to the Sacred Writings that didn't get passed down through the Fey Clan which the shadow network uses for a spirit medium to essentially \"Relinquish their soul\" to the agent in which they are channeling? In other words, could a lesser medium summon a great medium like Ami Fey, relinquish control to her, and allow Ami to summon an assassin like Lady Kee'ra to her own benefit?\n\nIn conclusion, while there is no concrete evidence that the Phantom is, in fact, Ami Fey, this theory does provide a plausible explanation for the Phantom's motives and their enigmatic character. This theory also accounts for the Phantom going to such drastic lengths to hide their own blood from the scene of all their crimes. In all likelihood, the Phantom could very well be a killer that has been summoned for thousands of years by spirit mediums to perform the darkest of tasks for the shadow network. In other words, if the Phantom were ever to be found out, then they'd be assassinated or the spirit medium would leave their form, leaving their true identity a mystery.\n\nAfter all, if the goal of the sniper was to kill the Phantom, then they could've very easily have done it, but they did not. And that could primarily be because they may have wanted the Phantom to remain ignorant to their own identity given their current breakdown. And maybe in the end, that's all the shadow network might have wanted in the end. But hey, that's just a theory!", "id": "132gwdn", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/132gwdn/ace_attorney_a_theory_about_the_identity_of_the/", "created_utc": 1682735293.0, "score": 6, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/132gwdn/ace_attorney_a_theory_about_the_identity_of_the/", "comments": [], "URLs": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/13313my/ghost_trick_phantom_detective_ace_attorney_are/)", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Ami_Fey),", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit%C4%81bha),", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Sacred_Urn),", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom),", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Kurain_Channeling_Technique).", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Holy_Mother?so=search)", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Kee'ra),", "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131dftt/ace_attorney_the_redd_white_and_grossberg/)", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Shichishito),", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/ID_Card_Record)", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Shichishito)", "https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/KB_Security)"], "html_title": ["r FanTheories comments ghost trick phantom detective ace attorney are", "Ami Fey), | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Amit\u0101bha), - Wikipedia", "Sacred Urn), | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Phantom), | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Kurain Channeling Technique). | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Holy Mother | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Lady Kee'ra), | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "r FanTheories comments ace attorney the redd white and grossberg", "Shichishito), | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "ID Card Record) | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "Shichishito) | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom", "KB Security) | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom"]},{"title": "[The Godfather] Clemenza and his \u201cheart attack\u201d\u2026", "selftext": "Between the event of GF part 1 and part 2, Clemenza dies of a \u201cheart attack\u201d off-screen.

According to this video (see link at end of post) the most common theory is that the Rosato brothers had something to do with it because they stood to benefit to from his death, but I have a couple of issues with this. Firstly, how did they kill him to make it look like a heart attack? The video doesn\u2019t say anything about that.

Evidence for this includes:\n\n1. Captain Hook is the spitting image of King Charles II of England - with dark or black curly hair and \"Stewart/Stuart resemblance\", with the only difference being Hook's blue eyes.\n2. Hook sharing personality traits, mannerisms, and physical features with both King Charles II and Nell Gwyn, balancing aristocratic dress and mannerisms with \"slightly disgusting\" ones.\n3. \"Captain Hook\" is implied to be a fake name and invented identity to conceal Hook's true identity. J.M. Barrie states in *Peter Pan & Wendy*: \"'Hook' was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would, even at this date, set the country \\[of England\\] in a blaze.\" This is especially true if Captain Hook was none other than the King Charles II's long-lost son, Lord James Beauclerk.\n4. The mysterious \"death\" and disappearance of the Rt. Hon. James Beauclerk, or \"Lord James Beauclerk\". Nell Gwyn gave birth to her second child by the King, christened James - after King Charles II's younger brother, Prince James, Duke of York - on 25 December 1671, or Christmas Day. Sent to school in Paris to receive an education fit for a prince when he was just 6, James Beauclerk supposedly died there in 1680 under mysterious circumstances. What James' life was like in Paris and the cause of his death are both unknown, one of the few clues being that he died \"of a sore leg\", which his great-nephew speculated could mean anything from \"an accident to poison\". This was published in the book *The House of Nell Gwyn* (1974). However, it is possible that James Beauclerk did not die, as reported - but rather, disappeared, or was whisked away in secrecy back to England due to fears over kidnapping and assassination attempts. His body was never returned; to this day, it is a mystery as to what, exactly, happened to James Beauclerk.\n\n\\------------------------------\n\n**Evidence I: Captain Hook is the spitting image of King Charles II of England**, with the exception of Charles having \"dark eyes\", and Hook having \"blue eyes\".\n\nPer [M.F. Webb's blog post](http://hookswaltz.blogspot.com/2015/05/captain-hook-and-merry-monarch.html):\n\n>As J. M. Barrie wrote in\u00a0*Peter Pan and Wendy*, \"\\[i\\]n dress, \\[Captain Hook\\] somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of \\[King\\] Charles II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts\".  \n>  \n>Hook also wore his hair in long black corkscrews curls, resembling the king's wig. While \"\\[H\\]is eyes were of the blue of the forget-me-not,\" wrote Barrie, there can perhaps be seen a shared melancholy in the faces of both.\n\n\\------------------------------\n\n**Evidence II: Captain Hook shares further personality traits, mannerisms, and physical features with both King Charles II and Nell Gwyn.**\n\nPer M.F. Webb's [blog post](http://hookswaltz.blogspot.com/2015/05/captain-hook-and-merry-monarch.html):\n\n>King Charles II's father, King Charles I, was deposed from the throne by the decidedly un-jolly Oliver Cromwell and executed in 1649, and the son exiled. Upon the death of Cromwell, Charles II reclaimed the throne in 1660--the start of the Restoration--with a style of rule so at-odds with that of Cromwell that his court was renowned for all manner of licentious behavior.  \n>  \n>Yet he wasn't neglectful of his subjects, as one might expect from his frivolous ways--when the Great Fire of 1666 destroyed three-quarters of the wooden buildings in the City of London over the course of four days, he fought the fire alongside the citizens.  \n>  \n>**There are any number of entertaining stories about Charles II**...He reinstated the celebration of Christmas, and was the recipient of the first pineapple brought to England.  \n>  \n>One anecdote which I haven't found a place for (yet) is about [Thomas Blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Blood), who attempted to steal the crown jewels (and whose portrait, incidentally, is a crucial part of the plot of *Muppets Most Wanted*). The crown jewels had been melted down after Charles I's execution, and later refashioned by Charles II, so this was a grave crime indeed. **Yet Charles was so impressed with Captain Blood's audacity that he rewarded him, rather than have him punished.**  \n>  \n>Charles II was surrounded by interesting women. He had a dozen (12) acknowledged children with a plethora of mistresses, including two by actress Nell Gwyn: Charles Beauclerk and James Beauclerk. (Among his actions as monarch was legalizing the profession of acting for women.)\n\nWikipedia also states that King Charles II was also \"fond of scoundrels and pirates\", like Thomas Blood:\n\n>The reasons for the King's pardon \\[of Thomas Blood\\] are unknown. Some historians have speculated that the King may have feared an uprising in revenge by followers of Blood, who were thought to have taken an oath to their leader. **Others speculate that the King had a fondness for audacious scoundrels such as Blood**, and that he was amused by the Irishman's claim that the jewels were worth only \u00a36,000, as opposed to the \u00a3100,000 at which the Crown had valued them.\n>  \n>**There is also a suggestion that the King was flattered and amused** by Blood's revelation that he had previously intended to kill him while he was bathing in the Thames River, but had been swayed otherwise, having found himself in \"awe of majesty\". It has also been suggested that his actions may have had the connivance of the King, because the King was very short of money at the time.  \n>  \n>Following his pardon, Blood became a familiar figure around London, and made frequent appearances at Court, where he was employed to advocate in the claims of suitors to the Crown \\[to the King\\].\n\nDescribed in an American source as a \"noted bravo and desperado\", as well as a \"ruffian and adventurer\", Blood was known for his attempt to kidnap - and, later, to kill - his enemy, James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond (19 October 1610 \u2013 21 July 1688), while employed by the Duke of Buckingham.\n\nBlood died in 1680, around the same time that James Beauclerk (b. 1671) \"died\" and disappeared. It is believed that Blood's body was exhumed by the authorities for confirmation: such was his reputation for trickery, it was suspected he might have faked his death and funeral to avoid paying his outstanding  \u00a310,000 debt to the Duke of Buckingham.\n\nWith King Charles II finding a notorious criminal like Blood to be \"amusing\", it would make sense that his son - James Beauclerk - might also find the life of a pirate to be attractive to him.\n\nNext up, we have **Eleanor \"Nell\" Gwyn**, the mistress of King Charles II, and the mother of James Beauclerk. Nell, who began life as a low-born prostitute, started her career as an actress and courtesan when King Charles II made it legal for women to be actors. Eventually, she ended up in the King's bed as his mistress, after also serving as a mistress-for-hire (escort) for various actors and nobles.\n\nCharles II also commissioned erotic paintings of Nell, the equivalent of nude photos today. Nell posed for at least two nude portraits, which depicted her as both Cupid (Eros) and Venus (Aphrodite), as well as [other portraits that showed her \"bare-breasted and stuffing sausages\"](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/28/nell-gwyn-charles-mistress-painting). This was in contrast to King Charles II's saintly wife, Catherine of Braganza, who was raised in a convent, and was deeply religious.\n\nUnlike Queen Catherine, Nell also bore Charles two children in quick succession: Charles Jr. and James. They were added the the King's brood of 12 or more children, all born out of various mistresses.\n\n[Nell Gwyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nell_Gwyn), with her [crossdressing and cavalier attitude](https://www.frockflicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1915-Mistress-Nell-600x470.jpg), and her propensity for acting, was also similar two famous female pirates: [Anne Bonny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Bonny) (8 March 1697 \u2013 disappeared April 1721) and [Mary Read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Read) (1685 \u2013 28 April 1721). Like Anne Bonny and Mary Read, Nell Gwyn also adopted a male persona.\n\nNell Gwyn also lived during the [Golden Age of Piracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Piracy), which lasted during the 1650s and the 1730s. As such, Nell Gwyn often played the love interest of a rake during her 7-year career as a stage actress. Some credit her with first popularizing the [\"Reformed Rake\"](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedRakes) trope in romances, giving rise to the phrase *\"reformed rakes make the best husbands\"*, a [Stock Phrase](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockPhrase) in Regency romances (1811 to 1820).\n\nTo quote Wikipedia:\n\n>This was the first of many appearances in which Gwyn and Charles Hart played the \"gay couple\", a form that would become a frequent theme in restoration comedies. The gay couple, broadly defined, is a pair of witty, antagonistic lovers, he generally a [rake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rake_(character)) fearing the entrapment of marriage, and she feigning to do the same in order to keep her lover at arm's length. Theatre historian Elizabeth Howe goes so far as to credit the enduring success of the gay couple on the Restoration stage entirely to \"the talent and popularity of a single actress, Nell Gwyn\".  \n>  \n>\\[...\\] In a historical context, a rake (short for rakehell, analogous to \"hellraiser\") was a man who was habituated to immoral conduct, particularly womanizing. Often, a rake was also prodigal, wasting his (usually inherited) fortune on gambling, wine, women, and song, and incurring lavish debts in the process. *Cad* is a closely related term. Comparable terms are \"libertine\" and \"debauchee\".  \n>  \n>**The Restoration rake was a carefree, witty, sexually irresistible aristocrat**, whose heyday was during the English Restoration period (1660\u20131688) at the court of King Charles II. They were typified by the \"Merry Gang\" of courtiers, who included as prominent members John Wilmot, George Villiers, and Charles Sackville, who combined riotous living with intellectual pursuits and patronage of the arts. At this time the rake featured as a stock character in Restoration comedy.  \n>  \n>\\[...\\] **Following the tone set by the monarch \\[King Charles II\\] himself, these men distinguished themselves in drinking, womanizing, and witty conversation.** Many of them were inveterate gamblers and brawlers. Some were also duelists, but not with the approval of King Charles II, who discouraged the practice of dueling.\n\nIf this sounds like something pirates are often characterized as, you'd be correct.\n\n(For more, see *Rakes, Highwaymen, and Pirates: The Making of the Modern Gentleman in the Eighteenth Century* by Erin Mackie: \"Mackie explores the shared histories of the modern polite English gentleman and other less respectable, but no less celebrated, 18th-century masculine types: **the rake, the highwayman, and the pirate**. Mackie traces the emergence of these character types to the **17th and early 18th centuries (1600s-1700s)**, when traditional aristocratic authority was increasingly challenged. She argues that the development of the modern polite gentleman as a male archetype can only be fully comprehended **when considered alongside figures of fallen nobility**, which, although criminal, were also glamorous enough to reinforce the same ideological order.\" Mackie also wrote the paper \"Boys Will Be Boys: Masculinity, Criminality, and the Restoration Rake\".)\n\nIn any case, the \"tall, dark, and handsome rake\" was also the type that Nell was quite attracted to.\n\nWhile King Charles II had thick dark (black) hair and \"dark eyes\", Nell Gwyn was reportedly \"extremely pretty, with long reddish-brown hair and a good figure; \\[in personality\\] reckless, but generous and unpretentious\". Another source describes her as \"small, slender, and shapely, with a heart-shaped face, light hazel eyes, and chestnut-brown hair\". (Some portraits depict Nell with blue eyes.)\n\nLike his father, Charles Jr., the elder son of Charles and Nell, had dark brown hair and eyes. However, [an effigy](https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw68438/Charles-Beauclerk-1st-Duke-of-St-Albans-James-Beauclerk) of the two brothers - Charles Jr. and James - shown together shows that James Beauclerk had lighter eyes; either a light hazel, like his mother - or blue, matching the eyes of Captain James Hook.\n\nKing Charles I of England - James Beauclerk's paternal grandfather - also had dark blue eyes [in at least one portrait of him](https://www.royal.uk/charles-i). Thus, it is possible that James Beauclerk could have inherited recessive blue eye genes from both his father and his mother, giving him his grandfather's blue eyes.\n\nOn Charles II's appearance: *\"Charles II's appearance was anything but English, with his sensuous curling mouth, dark complexion, black hair and dark brown eyes, he much resembled his Italian maternal grandmother, Marie de Medici's side of the family.\"*\n\nSo, too, does Captain James Hook's appearance resemble the appearance of Charles II: *\"\\[James\\] Hook is described as 'cadaverous' and 'blackavised', with 'eyes which were of the blue of the forget-me-not' ('save when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in them, and lit them up horribly') and long dark curls resembling 'black candles'...he is also described as having a 'handsome countenance' and an 'elegance of...diction'\u00a0\u2013 'even when he \\[is\\] swearing'.\"*\n\nThe \"handsome countenance\" likely came from his mother - the \"pretty, witty Nell Gwyn\", with both Nell's eyes and James' eyes being noted as their most striking features.\n\nJ.M. Barrie also stated in \"Captain Hook at Eton\" that James Hook was, \"in a word, the handsomest man I have ever seen, though, at the same time, perhaps slightly disgusting\". This, too, matches the suggestive and \"disgusting\" mannerisms of Nell Gwyn, the \"orange-whore-turned-royal mistress\" who was as beautiful as she was sensual - or, at times, even scandalous, sexual, and seductive.\n\nAlthough Hook is callous and bloodthirsty - again, a trait shared with Nell Gwyn, albeit with Nell trading verbal jabs, rather than physical blows - Barrie makes it clear that these qualities make Captain James Hook a \"magnificent pirate\", and \"not wholly unheroic\".\n\nMuch like Nell Gwyn, Captain James Hook also seems to be an \"actor\", of sorts, in that he plays his role of Peter Pan's pirate captain foe, as well as plays up his aristocratic mannerisms. Nell Gwyn also used her ability to creatively swear like a sailor while acting - a trait that both she and James Hook are noted to have in common.\n\n\\------------------------------\n\n**Evidence III: \"Captain Hook\" is implied to be a fake name and invented identity to conceal Hook's true identity.**\n\nThis section comes from another [blog post](https://benersonlittle.com/2020/04/10/captain-hooks-hook-its-most-likely-inspiration-and-his-nemesis-crocodiles-too/) by author Benerson Little.\n\n*Peter Pan* author J.M. Barrie\u2019s inspiration for Captain Hook is commonly ascribed to a combination of the painted images of King Charles II, plus various references to various historical Captain Cooks. There are several of the latter captains, in fact, including a couple who were buccaneers in the 1680s.\n\nFor more detail, here\u2019s Barrie\u2019s perfectly written description of Captain Hook, from Chapter V, *The Island Come True*:\n\n>\u201cIn the midst of them, the blackest and largest jewel in that dark setting, reclined James Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is said he was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared. He lay at his ease in a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his men, and instead of a right hand he had the iron hook with which ever and anon he encouraged them to increase their pace. **As dogs this terrible man treated and addressed them, and as dogs they obeyed him.** In person he was cadaverous and blackavized, and his hair was dressed in long curls, which at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a singularly threatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes were of the blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy, save when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly. **In manner, something of the grand seigneur still clung to him, so that he even ripped you up with an air, and I have been told that he was a raconteur of repute. He was never more sinister than when he was most polite, which is probably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of his diction, even when he was swearing, no less than the distinction of his demeanour, showed him one of a different caste from his crew.** A man of indomitable courage, it was said of him that the only thing he shied at was the sight of his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour. **In dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts**; and in his mouth he had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke two cigars at once. But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron claw.\u201d\n\nSo presents the man in all his glory, a Captain Peter Blood might-have-been, or a Captain Blood had he truly turned ruthless pirate, although the character of Captain Blood wasn\u2019t created until eighteen years later by Rafael Sabatini.\n\nA quick digression by way of annotation: the Sea-Cook is Long John Silver from Stevenson\u2019s *Treasure Island*, and yes, many men and women in the 17th and 18th century Caribbean, including English buccaneers and pirates at times, smoked cigars. For more information on the latter, see my blog post \"[Of Buccaneer Christmas, Dog as Dinner, & Cigar Smoking\u00a0Women](https://benersonlittle.blog/2017/01/01/of-buccaneer-christmas-dog-as-dinner-cigar-smoking-women/)\".\n\n\\[...\\] Shifting briefly to other \"Captains Hook\", the most notable is Roger Tressady, also Black Tressady, of the Iron Hand in Jeffery Farnol\u2019s novels *Black Bartlemy\u2019s Treasure* and *Martin Conisby\u2019s Vengeance*. Classics of pirate literature, the novels tend to be better-known in the UK than the US. The character is clearly inspired by Barrie\u2019s Captain Hook.\n\nFurthermore, Wikipedia states that \"Captain Hook\" did not take on the name until after his hand was cut off by Peter Pan, and he replaced it with an iron hook: \"An [iron hook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis) replaced his severed hand, which gave the pirate his name.\"\n\nJ.M. Barrie states in the novel that **\"Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze\"**. He is said to be \"[Blackbeard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbeard)'s [bo'sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boatswain)\" (Edward Teach, c.\u20091680 \u2013 22 November 1718), and \"the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid\". (In [Robert Louis Stevenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson)'s [*Treasure Island*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Island), one of the names [Long John Silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_John_Silver) goes by is *Barbecue*.)\n\nIn the play *Peter Pan*, it is implied that Hook attended [Eton College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eton_College) and [Balliol College, Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balliol_College,_Oxford), and his final words are \"Floreat Etona\", Eton's motto. In the novel, Hook's last words are a similarly upper-class \"bad form\", in disapproval of the way Peter Pan beats him by throwing him overboard.\n\n\\------------------------------\n\n**Evidence IV: The mysterious \"death\" and disappearance of the Rt. Hon. James Beauclerk**\n\nBased on when Hook was stated to be \"Blackbeard's bo'sun\", we can determine that Edward Teach lived around the same time as Charles Beauclerk and James Beauclerk, the two illegitimate sons of King Charles II and his mistress, Nell Gwyn. Charles lived from 8 May 1670\u00a0\u2013 10 May 1726, whereas his brother, James, was born in 1671.\n\nThis would make Charles and James about 8-9 years older than Edward Teach (Blackbeard), but still contemporaries of Blackbeard. (Blackbeard was active from 1716 to 1718; which means that, if James Hook *is* James Beauclerk, he would've been around 45-47 years old then. This also matches the age of Jude Law, the 50-year-old actor playing Captain Hook in Disney's live-action *Peter Pan & Wendy*.)\n\nJames Beauclerk, the younger brother, was born in 1671. However, he supposedly died at the age of 8-9 from a \"mysterious illness\", disappearing entirely from the historical record.\n\nPer Wikipedia:\n\n>Nell Gwyn gave birth to her second child by the King, christened James, on 25 December 1671. Sent to school in Paris when he was six, he died there in 1681. **The circumstances of the child's life in Paris and the cause of his death are both unknown, one of the few clues being that he died \"of a sore leg\", which Beauclerk speculates could mean anything from an accident to poison.** Her family's history has been published in the authoritative book: *The House of Nell Gwyn* (1974).\n\nHowever, as the circumstances surrounding the young James' death were vague and mysterious, I posit another theory: That he was either taken by Peter Pan to Neverland to become one of the Lost Boys, or that his father - King Charles II - spirited the young James away back to England, especially if his son's life was being threatened by his political enemies.\n\nThe first theory features in Disney's upcoming live-action adaptation, *Peter Pan & Wendy* (2023):\n\n>Jude Law portrays Captain Hook in Disney's live-action film *Peter Pan & Wendy* (2023), which adapts material from the 1953 animated film. \\[...\\] \\[In this version, \\[James Hook\\] was a friend of Peter's, and the first Lost Boy, but he left Neverland because he missed his mother. Years later, he returned to Neverland as a pirate, being rejected by Peter because he had become an adult.\n\nThis, in turn, was based on the 2017 book *Lost Boy: The True Story of Captain Hook* by Christina Henry. However, theories that Captain James Hook was once one of Peter Pan's Lost Boys go back even further, with the first theory about it on r/FanTheories being [posted in 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1nbgj4/captain_hook_is_a_former_lost_boy/).\n\nThis theory is also supported by the fact that James Beauclerk was a sickly child. Per [one source](https://www.wrongsideoftheblanket.com/house-of-beauclerk):\n\n>\"Not much is known about his childhood, but he seems to have been gentler and more obliging than his feisty brother, and a bit of a mummy\u2019s boy. This may also have been because he had a weaker constitution than his brother; aside from the usual illnesses that children suffer from, records show that in intervals during 1675-76 there were serious concerns over his health, and he was treated by surgeons using all sorts of powders, cordials, and medicines.  \n>  \n>\\[...\\] In the summer of 1678, the six-year-old James was sent to Paris for his formal education. We do not know anything about why he was sent to France, or the details about his school or education -- even where he resided, other than Nell mentioning in a letter to a friend that he was to be schooled there. Little did Nell know as she waved him off, that it was the last time they would see each other.  \n>  \n>Two years later, in June 1680, Nell received the news from Paris that her 8-year-old son had died. The letter simply stated that he had died \u2018of a sore leg\u2019, and whether that was through illness, accident, or, as some have speculated, poison, it was sudden enough that Nell had not been sent any information about his health, nor had made any plans to travel to France to be with her son. **Details of both James\u2019 time in France, and his death there, remain a mystery. And, as there is no even record of where he was buried, it is unlikely that his body was returned to England.**\"\n\nIf James Beauclerk had gone with Peter Pan to Neverland - the land where little boys \"never grow up\", and the land of \"eternal youth\" - it is possible that his constitution could have improved.\n\nHowever, the second theory is probably more likely, as Hook is implied by J.M. Barrie to have attended both Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, before becoming a pirate. Eton College is an institution attended by the wealthy and upper-class boys of Britain, including sons of the aristocracy, so Hook having attended Eton strongly implies that he belonged to the nobility - just like James Beauclerk.\n\nFurthermore, James' older brother, Charles Beauclerk, was given military appointments by their father, King Charles II. Per Wikipedia:\n\n>Just after the death of Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans, at the turn of the year, on 5 January 1684, King Charles granted his son Charles, Earl of Burford, the title of Duke of St Albans, gave him an allowance of \u00a31,000 a year, and granted him the offices of Chief Ranger of Enfield Chace and Master of the Hawks in reversion (i. e. after the death of the current incumbents).  \n>  \n>He became colonel in the 8th Regiment of Horse in 1687, and served with the emperor Leopold I, being present at the siege of Belgrade in 1688.\n\nCharles's eldest son and heir, and James' nephew - also named Charles (b. 1696) - was also educated at Eton College, and then went on to study at Oxford.\n\n>\\[Charles Jr.\\] was educated at Eton College from 1706, and matriculated at New College, Oxford on 24 April 1714. From 1716 to 1717, he undertook a Grand Tour in Italy.\n\nMy best guess is that, in this scenario, if Charles was given military appointments, then James - his younger brother - would've been given some, too. While Charles was given a horse cavalry appointment, then James was presumably given a naval appointment. Various members of the British royal family have served as Admiral of the Royal Navy across various ships in British history, so it would make sense that James Beauclerk received a naval appointment as well.\n\nIndeed, King James II of England - King Charles II's younger brother and successor, and the uncle of Charles Beauclerk and James Beauclerk - served as Lord High Admiral of the Royal Navy (1652\u20131656). (The late Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, [also had a keen interest in ships and naval fleets](https://www.royal.uk/naval-career), including preserving a [clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper) ship built in 1869 called the *Cutty Sark*.)\n\nIf Charles, the older brother, was given the rank of of a Cavalry colonel, then James could have presumably been given the rank of Navy \"captain\". We also know that Captain Hook is captain of the *Jolly Roger*, which J.M. Barrie stated was a [brig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brig) (most likely a [brigantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigantine)). Brigantines were especially popular with Mediterranean pirates in the 17th century (1600s) due to their speed.\n\n(The HMS *Interceptor* in the film *Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl*, for example, was portrayed by the brig [Lady Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Washington), a brig that also was used to portray Captain Hook's *Jolly Roger* in the TV show *Once Upon a Time*.)\n\n*This post has since been edited to correct dates, ages, and times listed in it.*", "id": "132dm8j", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/132dm8j/peter_pan_wendy_captain_james_hook_is_lord_james/", "created_utc": 1682725789.0, "score": 558, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/132dm8j/peter_pan_wendy_captain_james_hook_is_lord_james/", "comments": ["Below is more evidence, compiled by the OP - u/Obversa \\- and other commenters.\n\n**Evidence V: The 1680s and the Rise of Piracy**\n\nAuthor Benerson Little also stated the following in his [blog post](https://benersonlittle.com/2021/11/23/how-a-mystery-pirate-captain-gave-us-rafael-sabatinis-captain-blood-the-films-of-errol-flynn/) \"How a Mystery Pirate Captain Gave Us Rafael Sabatini\u2019s Captain Blood & the Films of Errol Flynn\":\n\n>**If there is a single decade or two that may lay legitimate claim as the ultimate origin of the greatest of pirate fiction and film, it would surely be the 1680s.**  \n>  \n>Counterintuitively, it is not the previous two decades, in which Henry Morgan, Fran\u00e7ois l\u2019Ollonois, and their bloody ilk reigned and whose escapades made sea roving popular in the public mind thanks to popular written accounts, nor the second and third of the next century when the pirates who sailed under the black flag reigned and centuries later became proud symbols, with little basis in fact, of social rebellion and freedom.  \n>  \n>**The 1680s gave us three series of events critical to all things piratical today, the first two of which are vital here**: the Duke of Monmouth, whose brief rebellion in England and Scotland ended at the Battle of Sedgemoor on July 6, 1685; the suppression of Caribbean buccaneering which forced the rovers into the South Sea and beyond, and which would thirty (30) years later help lead to the rise of pirates who sailed under the black flag; and the publication of popular editions in English and French of buccaneer-surgeon Alexandre Exquemelin\u2019s *The Buccaneers of America*.  \n>  \n>The Monmouth rebels are necessary to understanding one of the most common piracy tropes in fiction and film, one actually quite rare, if not entirely non-existent, in reality: that of the falsely accused who is thereby compelled by circumstance to turn pirate, excluding, of course, a few buccaneers who had become sea rovers due to Spanish confiscation of their lawful cargos. Or perhaps we should just say cargos, lawful often being in the mind of the beholder in the Caribbean at the time.  \n>  \n>And, in any case, these men were likely to have become buccaneers, no matter their circumstances.\n\nThe rise of piracy in in the 1680s also coincides with the disappearance of the young Rt.

James Beauclerk / \"Lord James Beauclerk in 1680-1681.\n\nThe Duke of Monmouth - **James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth** \\- was also James Beauclerk's elder illegitimate half-brother, having been born in 1649 to King Charles II and his first mistress, Welsh noblewoman Lucy Walter. After the death of King Charles II on 6 February 1685, Monmouth - a Protestant - attempted seize the throne by force from his Catholic uncle, the newly-crowned King James II/VII. Monmouth was caught, tried, and beheaded on 15 July 1685.\n\nAfter Monmouth's rebellion, it would be plausible that other illegitimate sons of King Charles II - including Monmouth's younger half-brothers (Charles Fitzroy, Henry Fitzroy, George Fitzroy, Charles Beauclerk, James Beauclerk, and Charles Lennox) - may also pose a threat to King James II.

James Beauclerk was spirited away in 1680-1681 to Neverland by Peter Pan, and became one of the Lost Boys, sparing him from death by illness. This follows what was presented in Disney's live-action *Peter Pan & Wendy* remake, which states that Hook was \"the first Lost Boy\", and was once \"Peter Pan's best friend\" when he was a boy. However, he returned to the real world because he missed his mother (Nell Gwyn), as James Beauclerk was a \"mummy's boy\", and grew up to go onto college - Eton and Balliol College, Oxford - and naval training under a false identity. At some point, James abandoned his naval post, and became a pirate under Edward Teach/Blackbeard on the ship *Queen Anne's Revenge* around 1716-1718. He was bo'sun under Captain Blackbeard.\n2. James Beauclerk was either kidnapped by another adult - not Peter Pan - and possibly held for ransom, or given a false identity after an assassination attempt on his life in Paris in 1680-1681. He was then raised to go onto college and receive naval training. One possibility is that Thomas Blood kidnapped James Beauclerk in an attempt to harm or extort King Charles II, his father. However, Blood wasn't aware that Charles II didn't really care as much about James as he hoped, and so Blood raised James as his own son. (This also ties into Blood later becoming \"Captain Blood\", a pirate, in later books.) After Blood died, James then became a pirate and bo'sun under Edward Teach/Blackbeard.\n\nDisney's live-action *Peter Pan & Wendy* adaptation supports Option #1 more, but the *Peter Pan* play and book by J.M. Barrie support Option #2 more. Depending on which adaptation you go by, either option would work to explain Captain Hook's backstory.\n\nThank you so much for your kind compliment, as well as for reading!", "That's cool as hell. Maternal or paternal?", "I don't think I'd say it was \"common knowledge\" but more a thing that if you knew who James Beauclerk was, you'd pick up on it. The context clues in the book were clear enough that it made sense.\n\nYou basically outlined why in your post. The biggest clue was your first point, his description was directly tied to resembling Charles II, so it would make perfect sense for him to be a relative.\n\nThe second big clue is how it would \"send England ablaze\" and create a scandal if his true name was known. Again, suggesting that he was related to an important family (the Stuarts).\n\nPart of the reason for why it could be inferred he was James Beauclerk was because he had disappeared the way he did. The whole mystery and mystique of Beauclerk made him an interesting figure for inspiration.\n\nWhat little we do know about Beauclerk suggests he died as a boy of about eight, but no one is sure how, even speculating that he may have been assassinated.\n\nPeter was a bit sadistic in the original book, and there was mention of him \"thinning out\" Lost Boys if they grew up too much. It's a long standing theory that some of them escaped that fate and became Pirates.\n\nOne theory states that Hook himself had been one at some point and had escaped Neverland and become a Pirate before returning to get revenge on Peter Pan. Possibly to avenge the friends who had been Lost Boys that Peter had \"thinned out\".\n\nAt which point he lost his hand and became completely obsessed with Peter.\n\nGiven the age that Beauclerk \"vanished\" it makes a lot of sense that Hook might be him. Peter took the boy to Neverland, he grew up a bit too much, and ran off to become a Pirate.\n\nIt also still makes sense even without the Lost Boy angle. Beauclerk just became a pirate and stumbled across Neverland at some point, where he lost his hand in a battle with Peter and became obsessed with him.\n\nIt is worth noting that Neverland is not supposed to be some alternate dimension or other world, but an island somewhere on Earth in the original story. When Peter says \"Second star to the right, and straight on till morning,\" he's using nautical navigation by the stars and not telling them to fly right to the start itself to some other world or dimension.\n\nBasically, they were flying to some uncharted island in the Atlantic Ocean where actual pirates might be found, at least according to the logic of a novel written for children at the time.\n\nSo Hook escaping Peter, becoming a Pirate, and returning to Neverland as an adult Pirate Captain isn't that contrived. Nor is him simply finding the island by chance as a Pirate. He didn't need magic or a flying boat to get there or to leave and come back.\n\nHe could still be a Pirate, and just use Neverland as a home port between bouts of piracy on the open seas.\n\nAs an interesting aside, Barrie once wrote an Opera with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and it bombed.", "So, should I assume that the James your post is about doesn't have a Wikipedia article?", "Even the blood disorder ([haemophilia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilia_in_European_royalty)) is something the royal family are associated with!\n\nNot something King Charles II is expected to have had, but Peter Pan was written at a time when European royal families were particularly afflicted by it.

This means that Diana and Camilla are cousins.\n\nDiana and Camilla are both granddaughters of King Charles II and another of his mistresses, Louise de K\u00e9rouaille, who was Nell Gwyn's main rival for the king's affection. Nell eventually helped to get Louise ousted from court.\n\nAlso see: [Clan Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Stewart)", "I'm very lucky that that the ancestry I can trace back is English and Scottish.

Him being a modern educator, it\u2019s already likely he is some kind of far-left individual who prescribes himself to leftist ideology. Charlie is also a pretty gay name. \n\nThe first scene in the film is a sex scene wherein Charlie is masturbating to homosexual pornography. This is one of the context clues that infers Charlie to be gay. Knowing that homosexuals will find eroticism in things straight people do not, I believe that Charlie succumbing to exhaustion is equivalent (in the minds of the fat fetishist homosexuals) to an orgasm. \n\nThere are several scenes where Charlie is seen nude or shirtless. These scenes felt perverse in the sense that it put the morbidly obese body of Charlie on full display for the audience. I can most certainly imagine a homosexual fetishist biting his lip and feeling a tingle in his pants, much in the way that I or another straight man would do the same when presented with an attractive woman (the gay man may also feel something in his nipples when seeing Fraser nude, but I don\u2019t feel anything in my nipples when I see a woman nude because I am not gay). \n\nThe scene where Charlie chokes on a meatball Sub to me solidifies the notion that this film was created to get the rocks of homosexual feeder fetishists off. Charlie is literally inserting a PHALLIC object into his mouth and CHOKING on it. This is clearly an allegory for FELLATIO! I don\u2019t know if Brendan Fraser is gay in real life, but it\u2019s hard to imagine a straight man willingly accepting a role where he sluts himself out on camera like that! For MEN!\n\nOther pieces of evidence for this film being fat fetish porn for gay men include the fact that the name of the actress of Liz is Hong Chau, which sounds uncomfortably close to \u201cDong Chow\u201d (a reference to both sucking cock and getting hard while seeing another man eat food). If THAT wasn\u2019t enough, the play-write for the original theater production of \u201cThe Whale\u201d is named Samuel D Hunter. If you didn\u2019t catch that, D HUNTER is homosexual slang for \u201cI am actively searching for another mans penis\u201d. As if BOTH OF THOSE weren\u2019t enough, Brendan Fraser could also somewhat rhyme with \u201cBend-Him Over\u201d. \n\nIn conclusion, the director clearly intended for this film to be about homosexual feeder fetishism. With this in mind, I find it hard to believe that this film is anything more than an elaborate attempt at pornography.

Each one are obviously set at different times but the most interesting one here is easily Attack On Titan.\n\nHow I see it is that AOT takes place in modern day post-Durarara!! x2, it just focuses on the Marley and Eldia conflict that the rest of the modern world have completely ostracized in absolute horror and disgust.

The entire cast of Baccano! are still alive to this day as they're all now immortals alongside Isaac and Miria and are now a street gang with government ties to them.\n\n2).

All three are (in addition to being young men though I doubt their age and gender would factor into the magic of it unless it'd mean they're connected to some specific mythic figure) smart-and-kinda-techy trickster-figures investigating mysteries with a high skill at thinking on their feet but even the two who aren't canonically said to have inhuman amounts of luck still seem to have things go their way/be able to get out of normally-hard-to-get-out-of situations a lot more than would just be justifiable by plot armor. So in saying they all have what Ezekiel has I'm saying it's something more than luck but magic, like I said in the title, just a kind of magic not dependent on them having any particular ancestry and something passively inherent to them in almost the way magic might be inherent to magical creatures as opposed to someone like Cassandra who has to actively cast a spell and what it does (in addition to \"breaking\" most reality-warping or mind-altering magic used against them it's just Todd and Shawn have never dealt with magic so they've never had an opportunity for that to come up) is basically if they're trying to accomplish a goal (or someone else they're with is trying to accomplish something they agree with) then at least 90% of the time rules/logic just kind of nudge out of the way to make room for their desire even if it's seemingly-impossible. I said 90% of the time not just because it doesn't mean literally nothing negative can ever happen to these characters but because it's at least been Word-Of-God-confirmed that one character has an exception, some Psych higher-up said in an interview that the limit to what Shawn can get away with (in terms of things like breaking rules that'd be hard-and-fast irl or getting out of seemingly-impossible-to-get-out-of-without-help-if-at-all predicaments alone) is when it'd be funnier for him to not get away with it (basically Bugs Bunny rules) so maybe Todd and Ezekiel also have \"kryptonites\" that are a kind of circumstance they can't get out of but theirs are different from Shawn's Rule Of Funny.\n\nTL;DR As even the two non-fantasy shows are kinda magical-realist (look at Psych's musical episode or the So Help Me Todd that just aired tonight and how the thunderstorm basically lasted the entire episode) The Librarians, Psych and So Help Me Todd could be argued to take place in the same universe which means you could argue that Ezekiel's luck, Shawn's \"working by Bugs Bunny rules\" and even Todd having so much plot armor it bends legal procedure are all manifestations of the same form of passive (i.e. not a cast spell) magic that makes all of them almost-always able to just nudge the rules aside to achieve their goal (and if Shawn or Todd ever encountered mind-or-reality-warping magic it'd \"signal-jam\" it to render them immune)", "id": "131k3on", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131k3on/the_librarianspsychso_help_me_todd_ezekiels_luck/", "created_utc": 1682664782.0, "score": 84, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/131k3on/the_librarianspsychso_help_me_todd_ezekiels_luck/", "comments": ["But how do these powers manifest?", "The way you explain it almost sounds like Daedric influence but in our world rather than on Nirn. \n\nThis could potentially explain away the plot armours presented in many other sitcoms as well.", "I thought I said that, as the example of Ezekiel should indicate, they're not really active powers in the conventional mage sense but more like a passive buff (hence why I compared it more to the magic inherent in magical creatures) that nine times out of ten (when whatever circumstance is their weakness like Shawn's \"rule of funny\" isn't in play) acts like plot-armor-on-crack and provides the Watsonian explanation for how much they can do the whole metaphorical cat-landing-on-their-feet thing and get away with what they get away with, because something-of-unknown-origin about their very nature just nudges the rules out of the way to give them room to work.

Ash has the necronomicon instead of leaving it in the past so they could conceivably be different continuities \n\nOk so the Evil Dead trilogy takes places in the 1980\u2019s through 1992 and its story mainly revolves around a group of teens going to a cabin in the woods where they find the book of the dead and open it which creates a rift between hell and earth from which the Kandarian demon comes forth. It then kills them or possesses them all one by one until Ash Williams is the only one standing and he uses his chainsaw arm and boomstick to vanquish the evil. He then tried to seal it away with a portal through space and time but got sucked in himself into medieval times where he again had to defeat evil and \n\nSo my theory goes what if it wasn\u2019t the kandarian demon which attacked Ash and his friends but the possession devil, which in this case would be the first devil on earth. In the movies the \u201cdemon\u201d or \u201cevil force\u201d is seen as possessing various people and things such as mounted deer heads and even the forest itself which makes sense for a devil who\u2019s gimmick is things that shouldn\u2019t be alive being controlled as well as people not being truly themselves. This can also be seen in Evil Dead 3 when there is literally an \u201cevil ash\u201d who acts as the ultimate antithesis to everything Ash is further showing this fear of not really being yourself.\n\nAlso at the end of Evil Dead 3 it is shown that a rift between hell and earth still exists as a possessed woman attacks Ash at his job and he kills her with a rifle.\n\nSo then what if this rift causes all the devils from the chainsaw man universe to enter earth? By the time of 1997 people would have had up to 5 years to learn how to live in this new devil infested world. So then what if Pochita is not really the chainsaw devil but rather a representation of the chosen one (Ash) manifested by how much evil fears him. This would explain why he was relatively harmless to Denji as Ash never hurts or kills regular humans even though as chainsaw devil would be pretty powerful considering chainsaws are great psychological warfare tools and likely would have attacked Denji.\n\nIt would also explain his special ability to permanently erase a devil as hell would fear Ash as the chainsaw-handed chosen one who banished evil everywhere it showed up. Plus it\u2019s mentioned that guns used to be used a lot to fight devils which is likely something people picked up from Ash and his boomstick at least before the gun devil showed up. Also would be fitting how his ultimate enemy was the control devil (very close in concept to the possession devil) so the legacy of Ash lives on in Denji halfway across the world from where it all started.", "id": "131jqu4", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131jqu4/chainsaw_man_and_evil_dead_are_in_the_same/", "created_utc": 1682663512.0, "score": 156, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/131jqu4/chainsaw_man_and_evil_dead_are_in_the_same/", "comments": ["I absolutely love this even though there's no way in hell it's be canon.", "I think at the very least you\u2019ve convinced me that Evil Dead gave the creators the idea for chainsaw man", "Anytime I see the words \"**Ok, but what if**\" I know a big leap in mental gymnastics is about to take place.", "Yeah, this is absolutely bananas, but i like it", "Groovy.", "There was an unofficial [crossover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK7XWijJKRA) released recently.", "I absolutely love this.", "Alright you primitive screw head, here's why you live in a dude's shed.", "It bothers me a bit that you're calling the third movie Evil Dead 3 and not Army of Darkness", "Watch Fujimoto just casually drop a line in an interview next year about how \"actually, there's this American horror film franchise, which I always envisioned Chainsaw Man to be a continuation of,\"", "Oh absolutely- Fujimoto is a massive fan of western media, especially movies.

Spoilers for likely all games in the series once this theory gets fully fleshed out, but those won't be posted here, so I'll keep things Trilogy/Mainline related. If you proceed to that link I posted above, know you have been warned!\n\nMany Ace Attorney fans consider Dahlia Hawthorne as one of the most evil and manipulative villains in the series, and for good reason. She committed several murders, manipulated and betrayed people left and right, and even planned to kill Maya Fey, Mia's sister and assistant to her alleged former boyfriend Phoenix Wright. However, what if there was more to Dahlia's story than meets the eye? What if Dahlia's soul was never truly evil, but was instead manipulated and corrupted by the people around her?\n\nAlso, I can present some evidence to refute something about the conventional take on Dahlia being an evil spirit when she was summoned by Misty Fey. When Dahlia says she was channeled by Misty Fey in the games, she claimed to have put on a hood similar to one that Iris wore. Now, if one considers the court record on [Iris's hood](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Iris's_Hood), we can see a startling tidbit of information in the description of the hood: **A magical hood said to offer protection from evil spirits.** Now, assuming the magical hood was to do its job, wouldn't Misty Fey be warded from Dahlia's evil essence if she had one? And wouldn't Dahlia in that moment basically exorcise herself in the process by doing this if she were truly evil?\n\nI'd like to propose a rebuttal theory to this that confronts this contradiction in the Court Record in Bridge to the Turnabout. Namely that Dahlia's soul was not one of strength and power, as her twin sister Iris claimed, but was actually filled with wisdom, as symbolized by the blue flames around her during her exorcism from Maya's body. These flames were in the shape of a spiritual nine, which could be emblematic of a Fey clan soul. Moreover, wisdom is associated with an iris flower, which could be a hint that Dahlia was actually the one raised by Bikini in Hazakura and not Iris.\n\nFirstly, it is possible that Iris was never switched with Dahlia until Phoenix Wright's trial, and after Iris was arrested, [the shadow network](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131dftt/ace_attorney_the_redd_white_and_grossberg/) backed by government corruption could have exploited her as a spirit medium. In this case, Iris would not have been able to channel spirits, but [the shadow network](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131dftt/ace_attorney_the_redd_white_and_grossberg/) may have used her to gain access to places like the Hazakura Temple by having her take Dahlia's place. It is possible that hair dye was used to create a resemblance between the sisters. And as a result, Iris was taken away from prison, and Dahlia Hawthorne was put in her place to suffer for the crimes that she didn't commit.\n\nThe second possibility is that \"Dahlia,\" in this case, the one Mia suspects for the crimes, was always truly Iris Hawthorne. In this scenario, Iris could have been the one to date all the men in the first place, and \"Iris\" (or the one we think of as the dead Dahlia in the games) never actually dated them. \"Dahlia\" would have committed the crimes against Valerie, Terry, Diego, Doug, and Phoenix all by herself, without \"Iris\" knowing about it. This theory would also account for the hood that Dahlia put on when channeled by Misty Fey.\n\nAlso, it's possible that Dahlia did not try to kill Maya Fey, but rather wanted her to know the truth about what happened to her. Godot had a grudge against \"Dahlia,\" and Godot did not stop to question whether she was actually the \"Dahlia\" Hawthorne that he felt in his heart was responsible for everything done to him and Mia. The [the shadow network](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131dftt/ace_attorney_the_redd_white_and_grossberg/), which is unfeeling and exploitative, could have been behind the malpractice and quack doctors that assigned true names to babies for the purposes of having illicit spiritual mediums summon them to nefarious ends, and this could have included the true names of Dahlia and Iris.\n\nI believe that [the shadow network](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131dftt/ace_attorney_the_redd_white_and_grossberg/), a mysterious organization that influences many events in the Ace Attorney universe, assigned Dahlia the name of \"Dahlia\" as her true name, even though her soul was akin to that of an iris flower. [The shadow network](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131dftt/ace_attorney_the_redd_white_and_grossberg/) may have taken a girl with a similar soul and gave her the name and identity of Dahlia, without the knowledge of her biological parents. This could explain why Dahlia's soul never showed up until her exorcism, and why Iris mysteriously disappeared from Phoenix's life following Bridge to the Turnabout.\n\nI also believe that there in fact could be a good argument that subliminally layered contextual evidence exists showing that [the shadow network](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/131dftt/ace_attorney_the_redd_white_and_grossberg/) may have used malpractice and quack doctors to assign true names to babies, rather than the parents themselves. This could be a nod to the case of Mimi Miney and Turner Grey in Ace Attorney Game 2, where Turner wanted to bring Mimi under malpractice charges. Additionally, Dr. Hotti at the Hickfield Clinic leaves this theory as one that surprisingly accounts for the sheer medical malpractice happening all over clinics in the Ace Attorney universe.\n\nAdditionally, Dahlia's mother, Morgan Fey, who was also her cellmate in prison, may have psychologically abused her and convinced her to believe that she was the monstrous \"Dahlia\" Hawthorne that Iris pulled over everyone's eyes. Morgan could have even been aware of the fact that Dahlia was not the same girl who committed those heinous crimes, and that it was actually Iris, but did not mind Iris's existence because she could mold innocent Dahlia into her puppet for her own self-interest. This could also explain Dahlia's hatred for her mother and her desire to kill Maya, whom she may have seen as a younger and innocent version of herself.\n\nIn other words, I'd like to conclude my theory by highlighting the possibility that Dahlia's soul was never truly evil because she had never committed a murder before her arrest, and that she was just a victim of the people in her life who manipulated her. However, Dahlia never got the chance to prove anyone wrong, and her tragic fate was sealed by her own actions and the actions of those around her.\nWhat do you think of this theory? Could there be more to Dahlia's story than what we know? Do you have any new thoughts regarding [Dahlia's breakdown in Bridge to the Turnabout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNd0WE518-I)?
